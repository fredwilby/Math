<b>Compare a vanilla wolf to a WolfNet wolf!</b>
</aside>
<p>Though it is natural to have low expectations when it comes to Mojang’s work, the wolves added to Minecraft version 1.4 are notable for their particularly shoddy functionality. The many flaws in the original implementation notwithstanding, the principle qualm players have faced is an issue of omission: while you can feed and even tame a wolf, there is currently no way to <em>capture</em> a wolf in minecraft. While many initially hoped this obvious inadvertence would be rectified by Mojang, much in the same way that sheep were updated to eat grass subsequent to their initial release, this seems unlikely in the foreseeable future given Mojang’s preoccupation with petty non-canine issues.</p>

<p>Seeing how this great injustice was severely limiting the depth of wolf-based play in minecraft we, the creators of WolfNet, decided to do something about it.This mod’s aim is to provide a complete, photo-realistic, biologically accurate, engaging replacement to minecraft’s wolf system. Though many changes have been made, we’ve tried to make it as balanced and lore-friendly as possible.</p>
