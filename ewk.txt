"There are nut cases all over.  At least Hakamaya had the decency to read Zhaozhou before deciding whether Buddhism was Zen or not.  He didn't find any practices, any mysticism, any sacred sutras or anything to attain.\n\nEverybody is claiming to know what Buddhism is these days, some of them even claim to know what Zen is.  But you ask them one or two questions about Zhaozhou and they fold like burning Monk's Hall.\n\nIn any case it is left to you to define Buddhism for the scholars and priests and the masses.  If you can't do it then you know you have a little more reading to do.""Don't be so melodramatic.  People cutting off their arms, traveling by public transportation for months on end, sitting determinedly until they cough blood... why all the fuss?

In that case it wasn't Zen anyway.\n\nIf you put Dogen's words in your mouth, that isn't Zen anyway.""\"How long\" is the attainment talk of Buddhism.  Zen is the sudden school, so even a blink of an eye is too late.\n\nAlan Watts and Hakamaya said something about Zen not being Buddhism a long time before I did.  Come to think of it, Huangbo something about it before Watts or Hakamaya.\n\nIf you don't want to take my word on it or their words on it, tell me, who will you believe?  Or is it that someone you believe already told you, so now you know the truth?\n\nAs I've said, Zen Masters talk about the other Buddha Dharma preachers as people trapped in a fog.  I suppose that everything looks like Buddhism if you are trapped in a fog of Buddhism.""Bardem could do it, sure.\n\nBut if we open with Judy Dench then nobody will @#$% with us.

What you call \"wandering aimlessly\" they call something else.\n\nYou have taken a quote here and there from some old men and grafted onto Buddhist practices.  I don't object to it, but your religion is not what they were talking about.  Thich Tri Dung was likely not a Zen Master, but a kindly old Buddhist who wasn't familiar with the Dharma of no Dharma.\n\nIncidentally that is why here and there in the old texts there is a question you don't understand or a phrase that confuses you.  Since your church can't explain Zen and can only preach Buddhism you are stuck.  Often is is easier to pass over the odd question or incomprehensible phrase, after all, you already *know*, so why worry about it?\n\n""What is this understanding you are referring to?""Once you figure out how to stop acting on negative emotions by being mindful, how will stop acting on mindfulness?\n\nThis is why Wansong taught:\n\n&gt; \"It cannot be attained by mindlessness, or known by mindfulness.\"""Consider it from the other side... consider Yunmen preaching his crazy talk.

This isn't shaking hands with people, nodding and smiling, thanking them for coming.  HE IS SWINGING A STICK AROUND AND YELLING AT PEOPLE TO GET OUT.  Wansong loves him!  Wansong can't get enough of the guy.\n\nIf you and I were standing in the back listening to Yunmen and some monk came forward and said something and Yunmen reached over for his staff, wouldn't we would run out with the rest of them?\n\nSo how can you turn to me after that, as I am laughing at Yunmen's sermon, and say, \"Why can't we have nice sermons?\"\n\nWe'll go for tea after, like we we always do.

Hakamaya sees that Dogen is nothing to do with Zen, Bankei saw that Dogen is nothing to do with Zen, this little buzzing \"ewk\" wasn't around for that.\n\nWhen I first wandered in here two years ago I had only read a little of these old men.  People generously offered me all sorts of suggestions.  They offered me Shunryu and Kapleau and Hakamaya.  They offered me the Caodong lineage from Dongshan to Caoshan to Hongzhi to Wansong.  Anybody who reads Caodong will see that Shunryu and Kapleau and Hakamaya are talking about something else entirely.\n\nAnd Wansong!  A crazed historian!  An unrepentant thief!  Not only is he an encyclopedia of the Bodhidharma lineage, he was in China when Dogen came for a visit!  Still though, none of Dogen's views can be found in his text or his history.  Wansong goes along with the rest of the family, throwing out Buddhism and all Dogen's views in favor of negation and rambling stories about Zhaozhou and Mazu and Yunmen.\n\nDogen's Caodong claim was to build a church.  Hakamaya sees that.  Bankei saw it.  Take it up with them.  There is nothing wrong with church, but that doesn't make it into Zen.""Disagree.\n\nMy aimlessness in the face of your belief is not based on pride, I'm just a wanderer.  I've heard sermons from all over the place.  When I am listening, I am taken in, and when the sermon is over I am aimless again.\n\nSome people like some sermons so much that they prefer those sermons to aimlessness.  I don't condemn them for that, that's their choice.  I don't say aimlessness is better, I don't confuse aimlessness for a sermon.\n\nIt happens sometimes that some people will sour on the idea of sermons altogether and yet have forgotten what it is to be aimless, or young people, not having been raised on sermons, will be able to refute them but become tangled in their own refutations.  With these sorts of people perhaps some of them may take an interest in the Dharma of no Dharma.  \n\nHow can you offer them your religion when what they are trying to get rid of is answers that come from faith?\n\nHow can you read, \"This very mind that does not understand is it.  There is no other thing\" and call your \"mysticism\" *what Mazu taught*?\n\nIf you are looking for pride, it seems you might start there.""Agreed.  Not one word of Hsu Yun either.  Not one word of Thich Tri Dung, either.\n\nThe difference between Mazu and those who taught you what you believe is that Mazu won't teach you anything.  Perhaps this is why you say, \"Doesn't apply\" to the Zen lineage.""I don't claim to understand anything.  I can talk about the subjects with scholars, however, and you do not seem to be able to see the subjects from that vantage point.\n\nI can also talk about Masters in the context of other Masters which you also do not seem to be able to do.\n\nFinally, I don't believe any particular person on any particular subject.  When it comes to Tung-shan's \"I agree with half\" the difference between what you believe you know and what I don't claim is easily seen.""If one wants to interpret Hsu Yu, I recommend asking Mazu about it.  Those who claim this linage or that lineage are deceiving themselves, and so are more likely to deceive you.  There is a reason that few teachers today teach Mazu and the rest of these old men... there is nowhere to fit self deception into their teachings.""Disagree.\n\nWhen I ask you to say a few define Buddhism and you hide behind faith, you are, just as Wansong said, revealing yourself through trying to hide. \n\nYour previous comment is the sincerity that I was curious to see if you were capable of, and it explains our different views.  ""It appears you lack a basic familiarity with both \"Buddhism\" and \"Zen\" outside of your own faith, and instead view the world only from within the context of your own religion.\n\nI don't object to it, and it does explain both your insistence on your own view and your lack of interest in texts by Zen Masters and texts by Buddhists.""I CANT FIND HIS WORK IN ENGLISH.\n\nYou still miss the point though.  How do we define \"Buddhism\" in a way that distinguishes it from other religions without alienating a majority of Buddhists?  Hakamaya proposed a three rule definition, why don't you take a crack at it?\n\nI don't say Hakamaya is correct.  I only note that people keep trying to call Zen \"Buddhism\" but can't say what \"Buddhism\" is.  Hakamaya comes along, says what Buddhism is and throws Zen out on it's ear.\n\nSo, let's hear your three rules for establishing what Buddhism is.  I want to know if the secular buddhists or the critical buddhists will fit in there.""The problem that you run into is that the more detail in insist on for your definition the more room for individual interpretation there is.  Unlike Hakamaya, you have presented a definition that anybody is willing to agree with...""Your sermons have become shorter since you arrived here.""Hakamaya's definition of Buddhism, the very essence of the practice view, is that there is somewhere to go, that there is a distance between ordinary and Buddha.  This view is not Zen.\n\n\"Digging\" is a movement toward something, presumably Buddha.\n\nAny verb we use, even the negation of the verb, is still binding us to the idea of distance.\n\nJoshu is asked what about whether someone who cannot be taken in by good and evil is liberated, he says \"no\".  Why?  Obviously he exists in good and bad...""\"Not mundane.\"""I don't think it means what you think it means... or he thinks it means...""Shhh.  You are giving out the secrets.\n\nOf course Gutei went the other direction.""The Secular Buddhists have some tough questions for the regular Buddhists to answer.  To get them on a panel would be interesting.\n\nAs far as Zen goes neither of these groups has any tough questions.  How do you ask tough questions of teachers who can answer the same question \"yes\" or \"no\"?""The question is not whether I mean it, but what you have to say about it.""I've heard you preach before.""Dogen's Zazen is a manifestation, it is a oneness-of-practice-and-enlightenment.\n\nWhatever sort of sitting the Zen lineage did, it was not to manifest anything.  Whatever they did, there was no enlightenment to it.\n\nDogen's people sometimes repeat what Shunryu said, that there are no enlightened people, only enlightened actions.  That's Buddhism.\n\nZen texts are full of stories about actual sudden enlightenment.  Zen texts are full of ordinary actions, not enlightened ones.""I haven't heard of Stephen Bachelor.\n\nI proposed a cheeky rule, if they started with Bodhidharma they they were Zen, if they started with Buddha then they were Buddhists.  I suppose we could say if they start with Dogen, their Dogen Buddhists.\n\nIf we compare Book of Serenity to Kapleau or Shunryu, just who they talk about is enough to tell the difference.  \n\n""It is this \"chunks of wood\" and the idea of \"treasure further in\" that is Buddhist.\n\nMazu said, \"This very mind that does not understand is it.  There is no other thing.\"\n\nI don't object to people digging for treasure, some like Thich believe they find something, believe that they can see good and evil in the world, believe that sentient beings can be saved by digging or by treasure or something.\n\nHuangbo said that you would save yourself alot of effort by throwing away the shovel.  Zhaozhou said, \"A good thing is not as good as nothing.\"  Bankei nearly killed himself digging before he saw through it.\n\nThere is nothing to dig for in this family.  There is no point to digging.  There is no one to be grateful to for anything.  When they said, \"Freedom arising from seeing into the self nature and thereby becoming a Buddha\" they meant seeing suddenly, not gazing, they meant Freedom, not perpetual practice or indefatigable pursuit of peace and good and the benefit of all sentient beings.\n""Sometime around Hui-neng the name \"Zen\" was adopted.  I didn't find it in the Tun-huang.  It's in the Wake Up Sermon, but not Outline of Practice or in the Bloodstream.  It's not in Faith in Mind.  But those are all documents of questionable origin.\n\nSuzuki said or maybe just implied it was assigned and then accepted.  This constitutes an informal survey at best.\n""Oh!  You think Hakamaya *invented* his criteria!\n\nDon't we often have this conversation you and I?  As if you believe that there are so many new and original thinkers!  As if monks with no other occupation then talking couldn't have come up with Hakamaya's definition!  As if Huangbo never was asked about Buddhist compassion, but just one day decided to be a wiseacre on the subject!""When in the presence of the holy I say, \"This is holy.\"\n\nWhen in the presence of the mundane I say, \"This is mundane.\"""Foyan said that there was no difference between working through reading, through sitting meditation, or through observing the world.\n\nIncidentally Foyan, Mumon, and Wansong are Masters who left specific written texts in contrast with Masters who were recorded by others.\n\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/zen/wiki/lineagetexts""Somebody around here might be able to say what attendants are called these days...""!""Your view is a reasonable one, however:\n\n1.  Many Buddhists don't agree with Hakamaya.\n2.  These Buddhists don't always have a fully developed definition of \"Buddhism\" or criteria for what is and isn't.\n3.  The often apparently contradictory nature of the texts attributed to Buddha turns discussions without a definition into a morass of \"I believe.\"\n\nSo while you and I might not have anything further to discuss with Hakamaya, putting his views in front of Buddhists to elicit definitions and criteria can set the table for a conversation that predicates the morass of \"I believe.\"\n\nFurther, it would be interesting to know how Americans and particularly how Japanese have criticized Critical Buddhism, but I haven't found translations of the books or discussions of the text yet.  Much like [the response from the Secular Buddhists](http://secularbuddhism.org.nz/resources/documents/the-sources-of-secular-buddhism/) that was posted here awhile ago, the counter argument conversation can be very interesting and reveal elements of the definitions and/or criteria that might otherwise have been overlooked.""Whatever you like.""That's on my list to read someday when I've read all the texts by Masters.  Scholars tend to misunderstand Zen Masters, much like novices.\n\nWansong rejects, among other definitions, Hakamaya's Buddhism.  Was there another Buddhism you were asking about, or did you want to talk about Wansong's view of Hakamaya's definition?\n""Other than your belief in Dogen, there isn't any evidence of it.\n\nWhat if I said I went to China for five years and now I'm a Zen Master?  If you aren't going to take everybody's word for it, then you can't take anybody's word for it.\n\nRidiculous.\n\nI don't object to your faith, but it's yours.  You keep it.""There are so many imaginary Buddhas!  Huangbo rejected them all.  Of course they gave his family the name \"Zen\" to make their disapproval clear.\n\n""This is a satirical take on very real problem in Buddhism, much like the \"problem of evil\" in Christianity.  Many Buddhists believe in letting go of desires, except of course the desire to save everyone.  Huangbo dealt with it neatly but based on that some Buddhists have thrown him out of the club.""Closed for lunch.""Again, when we talk about \"seated dhyana\" this is not \"Zazen\".  \"Zazen\" has become a term of art that specifically refers to Dogen's practice-enlightenment in modern contexts and most if not all Japanese texts.\n\nIn Chinese texts \"seated dhyana\" is open for interpretation. \n \n1. We have Suzuki's argument that \"Zen\" comes from \"Chan\" which comes from \"Dhyana\" and that Bodhidharma was called \"Chan\" because those practicing Buddhism in China when he got there were branding his teaching as \"other\".  Further Suzuki argues that since there was lots of sitting meditation Buddhism being practiced when Bodhidharma arrived that whatever Bodhidharma taught that was branded as \"other\" it wasn't simply sitting meditation.\n2.  Whatever the Buddhists called their meditation in China prior to Bodhidharma, we also have the Northern School sitting meditation that Shen Hui is famed for mocking and rejecting (and he isn't the only one.)  While many Zen Masters refer to, practice, or otherwise endorse meditation, and equal number reject it as the context for Zen enlightenment.  Nevertheless, all of it is called \"sitting dhyana\" as far as I've found.\n3.  That some sitting meditation is not endorsed by some views is commonplace, for example some Soto voices I've encountered are very direct about how some meditation is not Zazen, this occasionally comes up in regard to yogic sitting meditation(s).""\"Half\" is acceptable.""I'll have to keep my eye out for lion references.  I wonder how many I've missed so far.\n\nSpeaking of which do you know the two tigers story?\n&gt;Karin [the head monk from Isan's Bottle] was visited once by Haikyu, a scholar connected with the Obaku Branch of Zen.  It was Kaikyu who collected Obaku's Den-shin-hoyo, and wrote a preface for it.  Haikyu said to Karin, \"You have no attendants?\"  \"Yes, I have two, but I can hardly show them to visitors.\"  \"Where are they then?\"  At this Karin shouted, \"Daiku!  Shoku!\"  and, to the amazement of Haikyu, two great tigers came out from behind the temple.  Karin said to them, \"We have a visitor, so go back.\"  The two tigers roared, and went off again.  But from this rather doubtful-sounding anecdote comes the fact that a Zen attendant monk is called niku, or \"two Emptinesses, also written as \"two tigers.\"  Niku also means \"meat\".  -Introduction to Isan's Bottle, Mumonkan, R.H. Blyth\n\nHere and there I've come across criticisms of Rinzai's formalized koan study.  I've encountered at least one Rinzai student who claimed to have been \"passed\" on a koan and somewhere else I read that there were Rinzai certificate holders (\"Masters\") that would pass students on koans based on how they answered, and then assign them new ones.""Understandable.\n\nWould you take my word on it?""I keep bringing it up because I hope somebody will summarize for *me*.\n\n[Here's what I've read.](http://www.reddit.com/r/zen/comments/1lgslf/the_japanese_who_say_zen_is_not_buddhism/)\n\n[Here is what we are looking for to read next.](http://www.reddit.com/r/zen/comments/1o8v0j/texts_on_critical_buddhism/)\n\n""Yunmen says \"big mouth\" also.

As long as you aren't fired or laid off you can pretend there is \"good\" and \"evil\".  As long as you aren't in a war zone, as long as you aren't out walking at night and come upon a crime.\n\nIn reality good and evil are not actually how we live our lives, good and evil are how we pretend to live our lives when we are safe and comfortable.\n\nThis is one of the reasons that people struggle with Zen, why people turn to religion in times of trouble rather than in times of safety and comfort.  It's obvious, or it seems so, that we should blend in and get along when things are going our way.  When the chips are down though a different sort of character emerges from people, the angry bull, the cornered rat, the vicious snake, and \"good\" and \"evil\" blur until they are revealed as the thought creations that they are.""I'm skeptical myself.""It would still be a recognition if they had never met before.\n\nOh Monkey!

Hakamaya isn't concerned with giving it up, for him Soto is not validated by the lineage claim.

There are numerous translation problems that go along with this, for example sometimes \"dhyana\" is translated as \"Zazen\" and sometimes \"sitting dhyana\" is translated as Zazen.  \n\n\"Sitting meditation\" is a broader term encompassing all the things that anybody has ever said about sitting.  This has it's own accompanying problems with various arguments being made about which ones are Zazen and which aren't.\n\nNone of this is my field.  That some people might mean \"any sort of sitting or walking or lying meditation\" when the say \"Zazen\" is not tenable outside of Soto.\n\nThere are lots of people, some Zen Masters, who said things about sitting meditation.  Dogen's Zazen, \"sitting practice-enlightenment\", doesn't appear in the Zen lineage that I've found.  ""Everybody in the Zen lineage, at one time or another, did some sitting meditation.  Nobody did any of Dogen's Zazen.\n\nThis isn't a fringe claim, this is a simple historic and textual observation.  I am not the first one to point it out.  Even inside Soto people have pointed it out.\n\nWhat Soto teaches about Dogen's Zazen is not only not taught, it is the sort of sitting meditation that Zen Masters mocked and rejected time and again.\n\nI don't object to your religious claim that Dogen's Zazen is the same as all other sitting meditation, or to be more specific, your religious claim that Dogen's Zazen is the sitting meditation some people taught but not others.  I only point that this claim is not supported by the texts and is explicitly addressed by Zen Masters who rejected what Dogen's Zazen is about.\n\nThose who sit Zazen are practicing something that Dogen taught and nobody else did.""Disagree.\n\nWithin the context of Soto Buddhism, \"Zazen\" is practice-enlightenment.\n\nWhat Dogen calls \"Zazen\" does not exist anywhere in the Bodhidharma lineage. ""What is absurd is that Dogen claimed to have studied with Rujing in the first place.  Granted, I haven't found a Rujing text, but so far the Book of Serenity is a ridiculously elaborate discussion of the Zen lineage that deliberately and repeatedly rejects Dogen's views as well as Buddhism in general.\n\nWhat is absurd is that your view appears to conflate \"sitting meditation\" into one category without any reference to context or texts.  Foyan and Wansong offer teachings on sitting meditation that are incompatible with Northern School views on meditation as well as being incompatible with Dogen's views.  These are fundamentally three different views of sitting.\n\nI recognize that many people have strong feelings about this subject and I don't say these things with a view of insulting anyone.  At the same time there has been a tremendous dishonesty by Dogen's church which appears to date back to the first Dogen Shobogenzo.  First, it appears that the title was deliberately stolen from a work by another Zen Master.  Second, the Zen contributions in the early Dogen Shobogenzo appear to have been knowingly and artificially grafted onto church doctrine in order to increase appeal.  At least that's what the scholarship I've read so far suggests.\n\nI don't know where Dogen begins and Soto ends, so I have no idea how much Dogen is responsible for the religion that took him as it's authority.  His culpability is secondary to my interest, which is, apparently, accidentally, surprisingly, to return Caodong to the Zen lineage.\n\nOf course anyone can be wrong about anything and who am I to accuse a church of misleading people?  Hakamaya, for example, occupies a higher more respectable ground.  I would be interested to read your views on Hakamaya's work, or your views on the Book of Serenity for that matter.\n\nAs far as I'm concerned there is nothing wrong with religion if that's what people like.  If I was invited to attend a Soto service I would be pleased to attend.  This is not a conversation that has anything to do with me or with what I like, it is between Wansong and those who claim that his family is part of their church.\n\nEdit: Have you read Bankei?  \n\n\n""Originally I began with the premise that somewhere in the Caodong lineage there would be someone teaching Dogen's oneness-of-practice-and-enlightenment, the traditional Buddhist view of practice(s) being the road to attain enlightenment, and the traditional Buddhist view of good and evil/virtue and vice.  Instead I found Caodong Masters throughout the lineage to be indistinguishable from the rest of the Bodhidharma lineage.  The Book of Serenity is a testament to both Caodong's interrelationship with the Zen family and Zen's rejection of both Dogen's particular teaching and the rest of Buddhism generally.\n\nI recommend Green's translation of Joshu, The Recorded Sayings of Zen Master Joshu.  If you begin there, then you can compare what I am saying about all this to what Joshu says, and decide for yourself what sort of conversation we are having.\n\n&gt; A monk asked, \"What is your intention?\"\n&gt;\n&gt; Zhaozhou said, \"There is no method in it.\"\n\nWhat actions can you being referring to?  Zhaozhou didn't teach any, I don't know any such practices myself.""This isn't about what I like, it's about Dogen's claim to the Caodong lineage on the one hand, and generations of Caodong Masters who reject what Dogen believes on the other.\n\nAs far as what Dogen believes there is some disagreement about the fine points of that, but as to what the Caodong Master taught there are more than two hundreds of years of consistency and hundreds of times where Caodong Masters met, quoted, and taught the rest of the Bodhidharma lineage.\n\nIf you are interested in yoga sutras or Dogen, have at it, I don't object.  Here it says \"Zen\" over the door, here we gossip about the old men from the Bodhidharma lineage, about what they did, about what they said, about what they taught.  They didn't teach yoga or sutras.\n\nJoshu said his practice was wearing cloths and eating food.  Were you asking about some other practice than that?\n\n""This sounds like you are used by the 24 hours.""Don't be silly.  If I was chasing them how could I find time to read the silly things you say?""Oddly enough this has nothing to do with me.

I say evenness with mind is not comparable to mindlessness in unevenness.  That is why \"Selling people what they want from a markless scale, in both pans profit is made whatever the situation.\"\n\n""Which is which?""Choosing between things you want (road rage or \"zen attitude\") is not Zen.  Thus when it comes to \"the big stuff\" you struggle... because you were struggling the entire time only sometimes you believed you weren't.\n\nThe confusion is added to by the fact that many who say they are teaching Zen in America are really teaching Buddhism, a Buddhism in which some choices are better than others.  There is no \"better\" in Zen, no \"good\" and no \"evil\".  No \"big stuff\" and no \"little stuff\".\n\n""This is why I offered you Wansong today.  How much of him do you understand?""How practical and realistic is your philosophy of \"daily annoyances and petty emotions\"?""When I decide you assume it is the same as when you decide.\n\nWhen I say, \"You are deciding about me\" you assume that I am deciding about you.\n\nIf you want to assume that your deciding is the same as the appearance of deciding that I present to you I don't object.

Thus Joshu's \"yes\" at one time and \"no\" at another.\n\n\"Eradicated\" means \"cannot be taken hold of\" rather than \"not even the distinction\".  Thus \"eradicated\" is not found in distinctions and not found without distinctions.

Or is this trying only for those before enlightenment, and after they give it up?  \n\nOr Yunmen?  He goes up to the front of the hall and says, \"I'm making a fool of myself\" and then goes down again.  Or Tokusan, as an old man, is asked to say a few words to the monks because he hasn't preached in a long time.  He goes up to the front of the room, sits there for awhile, and then goes back to his quarters.  Was that his best effort?\n\n\n""Disagree.  Firstly, in that nothing has changed from then until now.  Huangbo and Yunmen were getting the same kinds of questions that we do around here, Zhaozhou and Mazu were humiliating people for believing in stuff in those days the same as now.\n\nOne slight difference is that Dogen's Caodong Conspiracy and the Japanese custodianship of Zen was a train wreck.  Bankei confirms this, Wansong illustrates that Dogen took the name and nothing else. Hakamaya is the true spirit of Japanese Buddhism, and good for him.\n\nI have yet to investigate the other Asian countries much, somebody said that D.T. Suzuki put in a good word for them.\n\nIn the 700 or so years that Zen ran rampant through China there were maybe a couple dozen Masters, twenty for every hundred years.  That pace is unlikely to be equalled, it was a perfect storm.\n\nSecondly, in that the peak of Japanese evangelical Buddhism in America is drawing to a close, the exotic appeal of shaved heads sitting in rows and the lure of inner peace is meeting the full force of a new kind of Christianity in America, and perhaps a new kind of Catholicism as well.\n\nBooks last a long long time.  Eventually one or two fools will read a few.  Four or five Masters every hundred years seems a reasonable number.  One or two Blyths, D.T. Suzukis, or Alan Watts every hundred years is also reasonable.\n\nIn this Zen business nobody saves anybody.  All the Masters are good for is some laughs, alot of \"no\" and a finger that points without regard to time.\n""My favorite is when some Master would send another Master food or a present or something and the Master would pull a cat on the monks.

Even when you go to church there is still a small voice in your heart that is saying \"fake\" to those around you.\n\nIf that's \"freedom arising\" and \"becoming a Buddha\" to you, I have no objection.  It wasn't freedom to these old men though.""I search for Dogen's practice-enlightenment in the Caodong lineage but it isn't there.  I read Shunryu Suzuki's \"Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind\" looking for \"When everywhere is not clear and there is something before you, this is one sickness,\" but it isn't there, just as \"the same as true enlightenment\" is not there.\n\nI do understand Hakamaya's disdain for D.T. Suzuki in light of all this.  Hakamaya believes in Dogen's Buddhism and it is not Wansong's \"without any process.\"""I don't recognize you.""I think you mean \"Dogen: Caodong Predator.\"""Japanese Rinzai and Soto are often indistinguishable.

Let me sum up.\n\nI came to the party late.  Some people told me about Buddhism, so I read about Buddhism.  Then some other people told me what they told Bankei, that Zazen was Zen.  So I read a little about Zazen.  After I waded through all that I came across some jokers who started Zen in the first place.  Not only were they not friendly to Buddhists, they weren't friendly to Zazen.  Not just of a different view, no, actually in aggressive disagreement.\n\nSo I started reading these jokers and occasionally I would point out that they weren't preaching Buddhism or what Dogen preaches.  Then Buddhists and Dogen's followers got upset with me.  So now we spend much of our time discussing \"the insistence\".  \n\nSo I post the crap these jokers flung around in a forum named after them.  Occasionally someone wants to talk about the crap.

Practice as a necessity, the danger of thinking of yourself as a Buddha, this is exactly what Critical Buddhism is fighting for.  The more the battle goes to Hakamaya and those who benefit from, teach, and believe in practice the less there will be any confusion about Dogen's Buddhism being related to Zen.  This is a very dynamic time for Soto.  On the one hand, Dogen scholars have a larger than usual role to play in the future of the church, on the other hand all claims to the Zen lineage may simply disappear.\n\nAs a further aside, for the last year or so I've been reading through the Caodong lineage, the lineage that Dogen claims he received the transmission from.  I started as far back as I could, and then read forward.  Initially I was interested to find out where Dogen's Buddhism began in China.  I'm working through the Book of Serenity now and it appears (unless there is a sharp turn somewhere in the text) that the Book of Serenity is stridently against Buddhism in general and Dogen's Buddhism in particular.  It appears that the Caodong lineage, at least from Tung-shan through Wansong (in sum 807-1246) is a Zen line, having nothing to do with Dogen's views at all.\n\nI'm going to branch out from the Zen texts to include scholarship on the subject, I have identified *Pruning the Bodhi Tree* and *How Zen Became Zen* as scholarship that may either point out my errors or be broken by questions.

If there are any unsuspecting novices who wander in here and end up with one of Joshu's slaps, Yunmen's beatings, or Baso's nose twists, isn't the warning in the name written over the door?\n\nI'm laying out the trap for you ahead of time, see?  You think I'm a cheat, I'll admit to it.  You think I deal from the bottom of the deck, I'm doing it right now.  I hope you find something in what I've said that fits your frustration.  We can talk it over like two reasonable people.  Then I can ask you to show me where this family ever taught anything without nuisance for somebody.\n\nI have great affection for this family.  It isn't my fault that people come to their door expecting Shunryu and Thich, is it?

We are all equally fools.

However there is no shortage of Masters that say \"no such work\".  This is, incidentally, what Hakamaya is talking about with regard to causality.

I now have a modest collection of links on the subject if anyone has something to add.  Two relevant points stand out in what I've read: \n\n1) Targeting individuals rather than comments ruins forums, even when it's funny, because it spreads over time.  Even in comparatively small doses it can have a chilling effect.  Not on me, obviously, but in general.\n\n2) While all the sorts of troll-confirmed and troll-accused behavior pose some problems in communities that are based on discussion, I am persuaded that non-persistent identities are the blue screen of death.  It's one thing to disagree, one person to another, but quite another to create an anonymous account that isn't an identity, but an outlet.  A glance at ewkbot's history suggests this account is an outlet rather than an identity.\n\nWhich brings us to the question of ewkbot's plea, as it is made by yet another outlet account.  It isn't about who likes who or who thinks who is funny... I think I'm funny and yet some obviously disagree.  \n\nThe question is why a reddit user with a main account would create alt accounts for specific kinds of comments and how that kind of anonymity and intention tends to affect communities.\n\n"":)""When Joshu answers, is he teaching \"The Mind is the Buddha\", or \"The Mind is not the Buddha\" or, \"Not something\"?

From my side of the fence we do get along.  That's what this is, this talking that we are doing, *getting along.*\n\nSome people have a narrower definition, perhaps to them \"getting along\" is agreeing or feeling mutual respect or something.  Tung-shan said of one of his teachers, \"I agree with half.\"\n\nOne of the reasons I laugh so hard at the lineage of Bodhidharma is because, as you say, they don't care to match the tool to the occasion.\n\nA monk once bowed to ZhaoZhou, and ZhaoZhou slapped him for it.  Another monk once came to ask Yunmen a question, and Yunmen struck a column next to the monk with his staff, answered for the monk, and then beat the monk, all without the monk having said anything at all.  Then there is Mazu!  Mazu!  A scholar monk traveled a long distance to ask Mazu about Zen and Mazu said, \"BOW DOWN.\"  When the monk bowed, Mazu kicked him.\n\nSo, perhaps not \"care to match\" but rather \"don't see 'match' at all.\"""You claim, \"His boast was his explanation of those things.\"\n\nNo.  No it wasn't.

You have your faith, and it doesn't have to be called \"What Bodhidharma taught me\".\n\nI've met some people of deep faith in my life.  They are like Hakuin, who is on the Dogen side of the ledger, btw.  I take the baby from them and they say, \"Is that so?\"  They don't calling me a liar or anything.\n\nNo reflection on you.

I read a lecture by a guy who loved the book and gave a talk about it, the lecture was also about forks\"?\n\nI am starting to suspect that you might not be completely honest with yourself.\n\nHakamaya studied Dogen, you know, in Japanese.  He appears to be a rather serious scholar on the subject of Dogen.  Did he read enough Dogen in your opinion?  If I take Hakamaya's word for it, is that enough Dogen?\n\nShunryu Suzuki and Kapleau, they read them some Dogen.  I read some of them.  Is that enough Dogen?\n\nI read some actual Dogen.

When he said \"tree\", I took him at his word.""\"Shame\" is always entertaining.

I come back here and I ask, \"Where  did they say that?\"  That's what I'm in trouble for around here.  Well, that and being an asshole about it.\n\nBut really, what system of values?  If somebody claimed the Declaration of Independance mentioned unicorns and I said I read it and there weren't any unicorns, that isn't a system of values.  There aren't any unicorns in there!  That's got nothing to do with me.""I could kiss you right now.  I am rather unrestrained in my affections.\n\nThe oak tree in the front garden ***IS*** a boastful claim.  He knew it when he said it.  His students knew it.  Yunmen, many years later, he knew it too.  Here we are, you and I, in agreement!\n\n.\n\nNow then, what was Joshu boasting about exactly?  I mean, we agree that he is boasting, right?  So what, specifically, does the phrase \"oak tree in the front garden\" boast about?  \n\nSay it!  Say it now!\n\nDon't be shy.  I can see your face.  Can you see mine?""You assume that you can agree with me without my actually agreeing.  This is not the case.\n\nI argue with people who make claims on behalf of others (as you just did about our agreement) but have no basis for these claims (as you didn't).  \n\nYou offered a opinion about Zen, now you offer another one (*\"I don't feel the nature of zen...\"*)  \"Zen\" refers to Bodhidharma's lineage, and you are giving opinions about this lineage, absent any actual reference to the lineage.  Do you think you can make up whatever you want and call it \"Zen\"?  You aren't alone.  Churches in Japan have done it for a long time, as Bankei pointed out rather sharply.\n\nThe point of contention here, as always, is that people claim to speak for the lineage, claim to have inherited something from this lineage, but when we look at the records left by the lineage we find that these claims are completely unfounded and often deliberately inaccurate.  But it's religion, so nobody holds anybody accountable.  Well, other than a few people here and there, like Hakamaya.  But he is as much a scholar as he is a priest, so maybe the problem is priests.\n\nIn Bodhidharma's family there are many examples of family members slapping people around (literally *and* figuratively) for making claims about Zen.  Most famously perhaps is when Tung-shan (Dongshan) questioned a head monk who died a short time later.  *DIED*.  Certainly you could say the head monk was old.  The monks around at the time didn't think that was it though.  The monks around at the time thought it was because Tung-shan SLAPPED THE CRAP (figuratively) out of the head monk for making claims.\n\nTo sum up:  We are not in agreement about our disagreement.  Your claims about Zen do not appear to be based on a text.  Your argument that you can say what you like because it is \"personal\" is not valid.\n\nIf we were talking about the Constitution of the United States and which amendment was which we would very naturally go to the text.  If we were talking about the atomic weight of afraidium we would naturally look at the periodic table.  Yet when somebody says Zen, why is it that the texts aren't the starting point?  I mean for those of us who don't claim enlightenment. ""I agree marginally.  Those at the edges of their fields have to be flexible about what they believe.  Those in the middle of the field who make a living selling their knowledge (and their certainty of it's truth) are more likely to be religious in their beliefs.""No.\n\nDogen makes claims.  The basis of his claims is his opinion.  That isn't my opinion, this is observation.\n\nThat you see this as \"opinion\" is a testament to your faith in Dogen, not to the reality of his claims or the qualification of my observation of them.\n""I don't know what you might mean by \"conscious\".  There are several Masters who speak to what they mean by \"seeing\".  Recognizing your own father in a crowd of strangers, for example, is not \"conscious\" in the traditional use of the word.""Agreed.  I'll restate:\n\nThe problem isn't that people don't see it, the problem is they would rather believe things, up to and including that they have seen something *that other people haven't.*""Whatever you decide to label me based on your system of values has nothing to do with me.\n\nIt does say a great deal about you though.""You have yet to actually debate.  So far you make claims and then insist that they constitute an argument.  ""Do you not understand what I am saying, or what you are saying?""There are two errors here.  First is of course there aren't any texts to support your view.\n\nThe second error is a pervasive one, at least in American culture, that was discussed in the (in)famous book *Closing of the American Mind*.  The author argues that American culture in the 50's and 60's adopted a tone of intellectual inclusiveness, such that anyone with an opinion was entitled to it without the responsibility of supporting that opinion with arguments and facts.\n\nThus I can't even agree to disagree.  ""Those with limited experience often struggle to experience new things on any terms but the familiar.""No.\n\nThat society creates a standard for behavior and demands people conform is artificial.  \n\nBelief has nothing to do with it.""No.\n\nDogen is a Buddhist.  He believes in a miraculous oneness-of-practice-and-enlightenment.  Like Jesus being the son of God.  Dogen also believes that this practice is not doing something and is not an attainment.  Like Jesus can resurrect people.\n\nWithout faith in Dogen's authority, his words are just words.  When they depart from the rational into the supernatural I don't go along.""I encourage that sort of discipline.  I point out that you won't find it in Joshu or Mumon or Baso or Ummon or Tung-shan's texts.\n\nYou are talking about a very real, very useful, very measurable sort of exercise having nothing to do with Zen.""When you say \"purpose\" you create causality, that's religion.\n\nWhen you say \"using\" then that is \"by means of\"... did you mean that?\n\nSeeing the self nature is words... like Huangbo's \"seek for an attach yourself to nothing.\"\n\nIn the larger picture, these sort of errors aside, how can the purpose be to not have a purpose?  How can you *not* see your self nature?  It's right there.  The problem isn't that people don't see it, the problem is they would rather believe things, up to and including that they have seen something.""\"Oneness of practice and enlightenment\" *is* an attainment.  Calling a mother a virgin doesn't make her a virgin.  What Dogen claims about his claims is just his religion.""As long as you acknowledge that your claims about me are in your imagination, carry on then.""Obviously.""Modern psychology is a dicey proposition.  On the one hand there are therapeutic  interventions for the purposes of reducing anxiety, on the other hand there are interventions for reducing antisocial behavior in children.

Did you leave \"claims of knowing\" out on purpose?""Generally I argue that \"religion\" is something done for the purposes of valuation outside of ordinary life.  If you practice meditation in order to pacify your mind because you like it, that's exercise.  If you practice meditation because you believe in makes you a better person or is connected with some sort of attainment or because it has something to do with Buddha, that's religion.\n\nI'm not sure what interpretation you think I have made of the teachings of the Bodhidharma lineage, Mumonkan for example, so I can't speak to any \"other interpretation.\"  Meditation and mindfulness outside of what Mumon taught has nothing to do with Zen.""You forgot \"claims of knowing\" in your list of things that this sub is mostly devoted to.""Do you have any examples of those who teach mindfulness and meditation but do not consider it a religion?  \n\nMindfulness and meditation assume values, and while one could argue that there may be a philosophical framework for these values rather than a religious one, mindfulness and meditation are, and have been historically, taught by religious Buddhists.""No.  Just a crazy guy who was one of the best short story writers of all time.""\"Shen-hui theory\" is largely an attempt to find a lineage for Dogen, specifically for Dogen's views on meditation.  Hui-neng is one of the sticking points, and Shen-hui Theory is an attempt to paint Hui-neng as the one without a lineage, rather than Dogen.\n\nThere is a long list of problems with this theory, not the least of which is that Yunmen, Hongzhi, Mazu lines all left texts which reconcile with Hui-neng, but not Dogen or the \"forsaken meditation Masters\".\n\nGuifeng Zongmi is likely not a Zen Master.

His definition of Buddhism is interesting, based on three elements: a) causal (you have to practice); b) altruistic (helping people, knowing what is good); c) valuing words as a medium for transmitting wisdom.  \n\nDogen wasn't really interpreting anything.  He was advocating a kind of Buddhism.  There doesn't appear to be any interest in Zen on his part, other than the occasionally borrowed reference and the title \"Shobogenzo\" which he also borrowed, the original being a book of koans.

You insist on an understanding of what they said that they themselves rejected.\n\nWhen I ask you if they taught it, you don't answer.  When I say \"throw it out\" you insist that it is \"true\".

The conflation of disparate traditions into a single category was not Chinese or Japanese, it is a purely Western invention.  You might as well invent a category called \"man-fish\" and then tell everybody it is a new Kingdom of classification.\n\n2.  The people we are talking about, Zen Masters, over and over again rejected the traditions you are referring to.  That one or another of them followed them here or there is irrelevant.  They said, \"traditions and practices are not what we are talking about.\" \n\n3.  While churches have an identity to themselves and their congregations as \"Buddhist\" there are increasingly more and more scholars inside and outside the church community who view this conflation as inconsistent with texts and teachings on all sides. ""\"Buddhism\" is a word invented in the 1800's that describes a non-existant phenomena.  Insisting on it as a category is simplistic and narrow, isn't it?""But did you read [Mumonkan?](http://www.sacred-texts.com/bud/zen/mumonkan.htm)  It is sort of a FAQ written by a Zen Master.  Is there any practice or present moment or ego death in there?""I don't say you are a fool at all.\n\nBodhidharma himself said of his teachings,  \"That is the mind-essence itself transmitted by all the Buddhas. Harbor no doubts about it.\"  You may have forgotten that I frequently refer to this passage.\n\nIn that \"Buddhism\" can be said to refer to anything in particular, it is linked in Western culture to those religions that put faith in the teachings stemming from the oral traditions that claim to be based on the words of the historical Buddha.\n\nHuangbo, who you quoted, is not interested in any sort of faith or valuation in the oral traditions turned sanskrit texts, just as Bodhidharma was not interested in the texts.  Even the Lanka was not handed down.  Nothing but the mind essence.\n\nNow, of the many claims that \"Buddhists\" make, certainly their various claims of transmitting the \"mind essence\" could be considered a basis for a category.  We could say that \"Buddhism\" means \"any who claim to transmit the mind essence of Buddha outside of words written or spoken\", but then all of those around the world with their sutras and statues and all that stuff, they would be out in the cold, not \"Buddhists\" anymore, but mere pretenders to a throne that never existed.  That seems excessive.\n\nIn any case this is the view that we could argue Huangbo held, and D.T. Suzuki, and Blyth.  I have no objection to it.  No Buddhism but Zen.  Huangbo and the rest of this family saw no enlightenment in the Buddha religions.  Bankei, for example, had trouble finding even a single Master anywhere in Japan.\n\nLikely this new definition of Buddhism comes dangerously close to excluding one or two of your own views.  All of that is not my concern.  Zen began with Bodhidharma, at least until those Indians dig something out of the dirt (like their unequalled spices) that bears Bodhidharma's signature, or open up an old temple basement door to find letters that the old foreigner sent home likely attached to gift boxes of tea that is no longer drinkable.\n\nHakamaya, among others, has eloquently argued for a definition of Buddhism other than the one I proposed, incorporating Huangbo at the cost of excluding everyone else.  He knows the Buddhist texts better than I do, and based on what you've said in the past better, than you do.\n\nSo when we discuss this subject we are not talking about it like two reasonable people, are we?  We are discussing your faith and any reasonable reading of the Zen Masters, even by someone like Hakamaya.  I have no objection to this conversation, as long as you have certainties I will offer you questions, and as long as you have questions I will point directly to the mind-essence... all because this \"rodeo\" is not mine, but one in which your faith tries to ride a stubborn ox made of the words of Zen Masters, but cannot stay on for long.\n\nIt is late so I've talked a long time about this.  If my taking the time to write all this down doesn't argue against me thinking you a fool, then tell me what my family said again tomorrow and I will give you a shorter answer.""!""&gt; 359\n&gt; \n&gt; A monk asked, \"Night rises in the Tsusita Heaven, day descends in the land of Jambu.  Why doesn't the Mani jewel appear there?\"\n&gt; \n&gt; The master said, \"What did you say?\"\n&gt; \n&gt; The monk repeated his question.\n&gt; \n&gt; The master said, \"Vipasyin Buddha immediately set his mind to it, but even until this day he has not attained its subtlety.\"\n\nThe distance between what you believe and what they were looking at cannot be crossed even in ten thousand lifetimes.\n\nYou claim to know the faces of you ancestors, but you haven't even seen your own face.""Sayings of Joshu\n\n&gt;253\n&gt;\n&gt;A monk asked, \"What is a 'man-eating lion'?\"\n&gt;\n[ZhaoZhou] said, \"I take shelter in the Buddha, I take shelter in the Dharma, I take shelter in the sangha!  Don't eat me.\"""Not so far.""That's an interesting argument, albeit with two rather large holes.\n\n1.  Many people, including the Soto scholar Hakamaya, have informed my view of what constitutes \"Buddhisms\".  Certainly they have their views, just as you have yours.\n\n2.  Those who would argue that I misunderstand what many have said on the subject of Buddhism are faced with the difficulty of saying both a) the error(s) in my view; and b) the specifics of what constitutes the \"correct\" view.\n\nThere is no question that many believe different things with regard to what \"Buddhism\" is, ultimately I suppose it is between Buddha and his faithful.  I don't pretend to be either well informed or even a interested third party.  When someone applies the label \"Buddhism\" to Bodhidharma's lineage, then of course they have to say what they mean by \"Buddhism\", and that of course is when the error occurs.""$50?\n\nFor that kind of money they better be passing the lemons around.""There is nothing to \"practice\" in Zen.  \n\nPractice and the present moment and ego death people are Buddhism, not Zen.\n\nAnything you can identify as \"maybe even dangerous\" is not Zen.\n\n""Hence there no need for certification in this family.  In contrast, churches need it as a sign of authority and compliance with doctrine.\n\n""Some places only have one or the other.""Noted.""Whatever it is that you ask about being empty.""How can you fit \"Is Zen empty?\" inside it?""It is interesting how rejection of idol worship and gods ended up with alters and the trinity.""It comes back on it's own?  Or do you not notice yourself bringing in back?""Agreed.  If \"suits\" is our guide, there is a great variety.\n\nYears ago I read a book by a Biblical scholar named Spong.  He argued that more accurate translations of Biblical texts lent themselves to conceptions of God that were not anthropomorphic... \"atheistic\" if you will.  Great variety!\n\n""The discussion of who contributed to the first version of the Dogen-Shobogenzo is part of where the confusion seems to arise.  One theory is that there were Zen monks that contributed, which accounts for the odd  Zen phrase in early Dogen.""What if you stop making it up?  What then?""With a little word substitution it all becomes clear.  Swap out \"enlightenment\" and for \"Christ\" and \"prayer\" for \"practice.\"\n\nIt took Bankei coughing up blood to rid himself of this \"practice.\"  Here I have done it for you with a web interface.""Yes, yes.  Here's the conundrum:\n\nIf I go to the computer first then it takes forever to get around to making the tea.  I'm a tinkerer though, I'll poke this or that without provocation.  So I could go to the tea pot first, but I learn slowly, so it would take forever to teach myself to make tea first.  Ah!  I could throw out the computer!  But then how would I order more tea?\n\nJust now I started thinking about those old time tinkers who traveled around with carts full of broken things they might be able to use later.  Then I wondered if there ever was such a thing or if that was a story somebody told me.  \"I should look that up on the computer,\" I said to myself.  Then I found myself making tea.\n\nHa!  ""There are many who sell bowls but all they teach is fasting.  When they hear \"Soup's on!\" they run for their certificates.\n\nI am regular in my habits, \"garbage in, garbage out.\"\n\n""So you make it up as you go?  Or are you a font of wisdom?""Ha!\n\nI'm not particular what I eat out of!\n\nI have a bamboo bowl and a Japanese bowl made out of china.  I have a pilgrim bowl too, it folds flat.\n\nNo, I am not particular about bowls.  But we are talking about food here!  What would your mother say if she saw you?""On the contrary, if Mumon hadn't overfed me I wouldn't be here.\n\nPeople get themselves a Buddha bowl and then they run around trying to feed everybody out of it.  What for?  Throw the food on the ground and the crows will feed themselves.\n\nUnderfeeding is what got everybody into this in the first place.  All these people who have been paid to teach but never learned \"no\" themselves are spreading the hunger but not the food.  These are \"buy a bowl\" monks who spend their days fasting.  There's your trouble, right there. ""How do you tell the difference between \"unhealthy\" and \"what you don't like\"?""It could happen to anyone.""&gt; \"I've just seen a lot of stuff out there that I regard as questionable teaching, either missing a Dharma Seal, or in some cases just plain delusional to the point where it will cause more suffering rather than end it. I try to be more concerned with helping people avoid mistakes that either I've made, or have seen others make.\"\n\nWhat you say here is Buddhism, not Zen.  When you say \"Zen\" it sounds as if you mean \"Buddhism that works for me.\"  I don't object to it, but that is not what Bodhidharma's lineage taught.\n\nThat Diamond quote is the sort of thing they were interested in, but as you can see from your \"questionable\" and \"Dharma Seal\" and \"delusional\" and \"cause\" and \"suffering\" and \"end it\" and \"try to be\" and \"concerned\" and \"avoid\" and \"mistakes\"... all of that has completely lost the thread of the quote.  It is as if you tried to pronounce some words in a foreign language and ended up saying something in your own.\n\nJoshu said that when a truthful man expounds a heresy it becomes truth and if a heretical man expounds the true doctrine it becomes heresy.  \n\nYou can see for yourself where he was pointing.  If it isn't clear to you go read some Joshu, and whatever part of it you find you rebel against, that part is true, and whatever part of it you agree with, that is heresy.\n\n""Whatever Osho and Gurdjieff attained, wherever they ended up going with their views, it wasn't Zen.  Completely unrelated.\n\nIn this lineage there is no \"unique path\" no \"methods\" no \"inspiring\" no \"beauty\" no \"myriad\" no \"selling\" and no \"justifies.\"  That's all religion and mysticism and philosophy.  It has nothing to do with Zen.\n""So you don't like a room in your house and you would like to go to the next room?""What was the question?""\"Striving\" of any kind is chasing something desired, with or without awareness.""The idea of \"truth\" isn't relevant to Zen... \"gets the feeling right\" is mistaking Zen for showmanship.  A rousing sermon will attract an audience that can't tell black from white.""Pleasure is the core of it; either consumption or control, either way the stimulation of the senses.""Disagree.\n\nEating oreos is no different than hording art, one goes in through the teeth the other through the eye.""There is a tendency to intellectualize problems like a white hot iron poker, but of course this sort of thought creation vanishes in the presence of a white hot poker.  \n\nBankei said when you are in pain, cry out in pain.  Further, there are several koans in which one old man or another is injured in the act of pointing.  These aren't saintly men nor do they have magic powers of resisting pain.\n\nOn the other hand they aren't chained by their objections.  Like a man going to the dentist.  That root canal isn't the best time you'll ever have, but how can you object to it?  After all, what is there to object to?  What is the matter?\n\n""\"Nothing to be done\" is more effort.  The tea won't pour itself.""Hedonism doesn't pretend to be noble; Selfless is based on pretending, it's pretending all the way down.""There is no \"profound\" in Zen.\n\nOsho was a clever man.  He used this cleverness for a variety of purposes.  He was chained both to his purposes and his cleverness.""It's like a choice between stealing or being stolen from!  If only you could put aside this belief that there was was something that could be stolen.""Who else?\n\n""Disagree.\n\nI haven't encountered in text or person anyone who does not recognize the inevitable failure of selfishness.  Hedonism doesn't argue for itself, the devouring is all the reason it has.\n\nPeople who are under the illusion of selfless though, they believe.  They *have* something fully devoured.""You said you were seeking something so how can you deny your dreams?\n\nHuangbo: \n\n&gt; A:  Do not look for what is called the Dharma by preachers, for what sort of Dharma would that be?\n&gt; \n&gt; Q: If that is so, should we not seek for anything at all?\n&gt; \n&gt; A:  By conceding this, you would save yourself a lot of mental effort.\n&gt; \n&gt; Q:  But in this way everything would be eliminated!  There cannot just be nothing!\n&gt; \n&gt; A:  Who called it nothing?  Who was this fellow?  But you wanted to *seek* for something.\n&gt; \n&gt; Q: Since there is no need to seek, why do you also say that not everything is eliminated?\n&gt; \n&gt; A:  Not to seek is to rest tranquil.  Who told you to eliminate anything?  Look at the void in front of your eyes.  How can you produce or eliminate it?""He talks like he believes it.  \n\nNot Zen.""What you are talking about is not Zen.  I have heard of what you are experiencing though... some Christians talk like this after they have given themselves to Jesus Christ.  The illusion of selflessness is a powerful one.  Saints had it, for example.  Now that you know, get on with the saving of all sentient beings!""First, there is no attainment.  Second, compassion for others is seeing them as not lacking attainment.\n\nThey are indeed a thing of the world.  \"Not of this world\" is what faith is all about.  \"Not of this world\" is peace and holy and the Backstreet Boys dancing in heaven.\n\nYou say you seek \"bodhi\" but of course you are looking instead for a dream that you have half dreamed, like everybody else.  How could anyone get free of such a dream?  For this reason, Yunmen would have beaten Buddha to death under that tree.\n\nAh, Yunmen.  What a joke!  There could never have been such a person who was not bound by half dreaming, there could never be *Awake*.\n""Not needed money or sex or whatever and mental peace have nothing to do with Zen.  Some Buddhisms believe in that, but that sort of pacification of mind is antithetical to Zen.""The Masters are clear about this: no such state, no submerging.\n\n ""Lots of people believe this of course.  It just isn't a belief that has a basis in the texts.  Not only do Masters advocate other methods, they warn against sitting meditation.  Not only do they talk about enlightenment without reference to sitting, they talk about it as both \"sudden\" and not related to practice.  Not only do they talk about \"practice\" by pointedly not referring to sitting, they reject practices and methods of all kinds.\n\nThe single most devastating piece of scholarship on the subject is by D.T. Suzuki, called \"the Zen Doctrine of No-Mind.\"  In this book he severs dhyana from any relation to \"seated Zen\" in Hui-neng's text.  \n\nI did not mean to imply that Dogen's sitting meditation is only \"seated\".  Just like other forms of prayer it can be done sitting or standing or lying down.  Just as Dogen's religion has nothing to do with Zen, Dogen's conception of sitting, the Northern School's sitting, and traditional Chinese Buddhism sitting inherited from India have nothing to do with Zen Masters' use of the word dhyana.  \n\nIt's in the texts.  There is no reason for us to disagree.  Pick up Foyan or Mumon or Mazu or Bankei or Huang Po or Layman Pang or Tung-shan... perhaps you understand Hui-neng better than they did?""Yet Hui-neng still found time to write a poem about how sitting meditation was the practice of dead men, mock the Northern School as teaching for \"small minded people\", spawn a lineage of Masters who not only did not teach meditation as the path, but mocked it themselves and called it \"not Zen\".\n\nHuangbo said something about not selecting a particular teaching and regarding it as immutable...  he also said \"naught but One Mind\" was transmitted... did he just forget to say \"through sitting\"?\n\nLook at all the Cases in Mumonkan!  How is it that so few of them seem to include exhortations on sitting?\n\nLook at how Foyan says that sitting is misunderstood by people, and they should just sit quietly for a few minutes on a bench before studying Zen... it's as if he agrees with Bankei, that sitting meditation has nothing intrinsically to do with Zen. ""Some selections from his Compassion text:\n\n&gt; Love, kindness, and compassion are the very foundations of Buddhism. From a general\nperspective, these virtues correspond to similar values held in many other religious traditions and spiritual practices. \n\nHuangbo was rejecting this very view of compassion when he said that compassion was not conceiving of sentient beings to be delivered.\n\n&gt; However, in Buddhism, genuine love and\ncompassion arise from a penetrating insight into the\ntrue nature of our own existence, and are thereby more\nfirmly grounded in a practitioner's experience.\n\n\"Genuine\" \"true\" and \"more firmly\" are generally used by religious people to distinguish their faith in something silly from other people's faith in something silly.  This preference for his own faith is something of a theme for Sheng-yen.\n\nIn Zen the Masters are explaining what they see.  What they see isn't better than what other people see, other people don't see anything.  There is no comparison.  Thus we have Masters saying, \"You know more than me\" and \"You are a better person than I am\".  They aren't concerned with \"better\".  Either you see or you don't.  There is nothing true or genuine or \"more\" in Zen.\n\n&gt;  When other sentient beings suffer in the depths of confusion, it is as if we ourselves\nare suffering too, but lack the wisdom to help either ourselves or others. This genuine concern and selfless love do not come from anyone or anything external,\nbut rather from our insight into the nature of our own existence. Such insight is the ethical impulse of an enlightened being.\n\nThis is \"Jesus loves us\" stuff.  Joshu said he taught those who came to him and those that didn't.  That was his concern for the suffering of others.\n\n&gt; For any Buddhist practitioner, the ultimate purpose of practice is to attain complete\nenlightenment or Buddhahood. To achieve this very lofty goal, we work to cultivate wisdom and accumulate merit, and through this practice we are able to benefit both ourselves and others. \n\nThis is a Buddhist doctrine, not found in any text of Zen Masters that I've read.  Several of them mock this kind of belief.  \"Void\"  and \"Nothing holy therein\" means nothing to attain, no \"lofty\", nothing to cultivate, no merit.  \n\n&gt;  In other words, walking the bodhisattva path is the cause of Buddhahood; Buddhahood is the result of having accomplished the bodhisattva practice.\n\nThis is an example of why I say that Hakamaya has intellectual integrity.  Dogen and Buddhists believe this stuff, but it is clear that this is not Zen.  Suzuki said it, Hakamaya said it, it is in the texts.  Read the texts, don't pretend you know.  Sheng-yen, like most Buddhists who say Zen, doesn't bother to read the Zen Masters, but he'll toss out a reference to Joshu's \"Mu\" like he read a book once.  It's ridiculous.\n\n&gt; To help us put our vows into practice and provide ourselves with a clear set of behavioral guidelines, we commit ourselves to a code of discipline set forth in a given system of precepts. \n\nBankei [has a section on vows](http://www.reddit.com/r/zen/comments/1knu3z/bankei_explains_precepts/) not being relevant to Zen... did Sheng-yen not read Bankei?  How can he give his views on Zen without reading Bankei?  Or perhaps he read Bankei, but forgot?  \n\nThe simple explanation is that Sheng-yen doesn't know anything about Zen.  He went to school and studied Buddhism.  He never met a Zen Master, and he spent his life in church like any other priest, with people who agreed with him about most things.  He wasn't fond of these old men like Suzuki, and he wasn't a scholar like Hakamaya.  Shen-yen thinks he knows things but he obviously doesn't, but that's most people in religion.  He isn't a bad man, he's just a head monk who never crossed paths with Tung-Shan.\n""Everything thing he says is full of the same errors and lack of scholarship.  I read a little of \"Practice and Faith\" and the interview I linked above.  I read the Gateless Gate chapter of Spirit of Chan, I read a little of the Compassion chapter from Bodhisattva Precepts.\n\nWas there a piece you were more interested in than others?  The simplest examples are probably in Compassion.  It's the Achilles Heel of Buddhists everywhere.  Once somebody believes, really believes, that they know the difference between good and evil, well, then they do.""Yunmen goes up to his Zen throne in the lecture hall and sits down in front of the monks.  After awhile he says, \"I'm making a terrible fool of myself\" and he descends and walks out.\n\nI read some of Sheng-Yen.  It is not simply that he does not understand what the old men said, it is that he believes in something they don't believe in.  Where Yunmen didn't mind making a fool of himself, Sheng-Yen really believed that he wasn't.  \n""My admittedly very tiny understanding of the kind of language that (most?) Zen Masters used suggests that \"expound\" adds meaning that isn't there in the sentence.\n\nI say most because I have Red Pine's translation of the Platform Sutra here on my desk... it is like Moby Dick, both literally in that it huge, and figuratively in that it is whale.  Regardless of the translation, the language there does not appear to be Mumon's manner of talking, thus Red Pine's footnotes are very extensive. ""What Sheng-Yen is talking about is not what Bodhidharma's lineage is talking about.  Sheng-Yen is the same as a Christian or a Muslim, and among those not a particularly interesting example of a religious leader.\n\nWhat does Bodhidharma have to do with \"Zen\"?  In that \"Zen\" is the name given to teachings of Bodhidharma's lineage, Bodhidharma is the Patriarch.  In that \"Zen\" is a reference to what it is that the lineage taught, Bodhidharma was one old man among many who wandered around saying \"Void\" and \"Nothing Holy Therein.\"\n\nSheng-Yen chained himself to \"Holy\".  He was condemned to wheel of rebirth that all these Buddhists talk about.""Take these two sentences:\n\n1.  He could expound on any subject endlessly.\n2.  He had nothing to say.\n\nI don't think we can interchange \"say\" and \"expound\" there without losing meaning.  Further, there is a significant problem with audience between these two sentences, many people do not know what the word \"expound\" means.  What I mean by \"formality\" is that translators consider audience just as Zen Masters have.  ZhaoZhou walks back and forth over this problem as he confines himself to informal language that everybody understands and then undermines this using allusions, innuendo and entendres.  ""I'm not sure what you are looking for or what criteria you are using.\n\nThe basic text on Zen is the book Mumonkan, or The Gateless Gate.  There is a free copy here: http://www.sacred-texts.com/bud/zen/mumonkan.htm\n\nCan you find any notions in there or anything contained in those words?  If not, then you have your answer.\n""Disagree.  Sheng-Yen is a Buddhist, having nothing to do with Zen at all.  He believes he does, he folds what he doesn't understand seamlessly into his religion.\n\nHe gave an interview that makes this clear: http://www.cimc.info/PDF/MichaelGradyInterview1.pdf\n\nI looked over the links on the site you suggested, lots of material.  It all goes along like the interview.  His brief discussion of the Gateless Gate is an awkward example of Foyan's comment on those who have nothing to say.\n\n""There is an ongoing dialogue about how to translate, formal or informal language?  It seems that, at least in the Zen circle, \"informal\" was settled on long ago.""The eye cannot see itself, you can't use fire to find fire.\n\n\"Glimpse\" falls apart when we ask *What is seen?*  \"What is seen\" falls apart when we ask *Who is it that sees?*  Thus Huangbo says,\"The Buddha said, 'I truly obtained nothing from Enlightenment.'  There is just a mysterious tacit understanding and no more.\"""One glimpse is all there is.  Sometimes they talk about seeing that is \"incomplete\"... this generally refers to something like smelling the cooking from the next room... but not having eaten the meal.  Sometimes people will recognize that there is something to these old men, something different than wisdom or sacred words but they do not see it directly.\n\nBankei's account is that he was near death and had not understood this \"bright virtue\" that he was seeking.  He felt a tightness in his chest and he coughed up a ball of blood and phlegm and he spit it against the wall, and as it rolled down, he saw.\n\nOne time, game over.\n\nTokusan's seeing was when Ryutan blew out the candle that he was handing to Tokusan.  Tokusan said to him something like, \"From now on I will believe what you old men say.\"  You can read it in the Chinese, I can't.\n\nXiangyan left the monastery, having given up hope of ever seeing for himself.  He was living alone, maintaining some sort of shrine to Hui-neng.  One day he was sweeping and he tossed a piece of broken tile (some have it as a pebble, swept not thrown) into a stand of bamboo.  At the sound of it hitting the bamboo, he awoke.  One sound, one piece of broken tile, one glimpse.""[That cangue looks good on you though.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=171FURqSIQc)""Anyone!  Why did you offer me your \"never\" then?""You buy this cangue, you get a free bowl of soup.""One glimpse; sudden as blinking.  One who does not have it has something.\n\nI went to find the Case of Isan's Bottle and I ended up reading about Isan and Kyozan... I'll post it.""What you are referring to is a title, such as one bestowed by a church and transmitted by a certificate.\n\nGoso said, \"man of the Way\".  That is what I'm referring to.  Such a person is recognized by other such persons, no title necessary.  Their certificate is in the greeting.""Don't work so hard at not being one.""If I don't fill the bottle and I set it before you, what then?""Kicking over the bottle.\n\n&gt; When Isan (Guishan) was with Hyakujo (Baizhang) he was the tenzo [who looks after the food].  Hyakujo wanted to choose a master for mount Daii, so he called the head monk and the rest of them, and told them that an exceptional person should go there.  Then he took a water-bottle, stood it on the floor, and asked a question.  \"Don't call this a water-bottle, but tell me what it is!\"  The head monk said, \"It can't be called a stump.\"  Hyakujo asked Isan his opinion.  Isan pushed the water-bottle over with his foot.  Hyakujo laughed, and said, \"The head monk has lost.\"  Isan was ordered to start the temple.\n\nIsan tipped his hand.  If only he had kept his mouth shut he could have continued to eat Hyakujo's rice and drink his tea!\n""&gt; \"unless by Buddha you mean 'yourself' I agree\".\n\nHa!\n\nThe question of whether Buddha was a Zen Master or a Jesus goes back to before the written record and oral histories are even less determinate than \"sayings\".  I have no objection to those who agree with you and no objection to those who disagree.\n\nThere are many people around the world who greatly admire Buddha, whether as a religious figure or a profound thinker.  Occasionally I discuss Zen with these people.  Often they are disturbed by the Dharma of no Dharma, disturbed by Yunmen's \"beat the Buddha to death under the tree\", disturbed by ZhaoZhou's \"a good thing is not as good as nothing.\"\n\nRather than argue about what Buddha was talking about, I just say \"Zen\" and point to Yunmen and ZhaoZhou.  Thus \"admire\" ceases to be relevant and we can move on to \"disturbed.\"""Buddhisms and Daoism were popular, culture shaping religions when Bodhidharma started teaching Zen in China.  Zen was so different that Zen Masters often used Buddhist and Daoist words when they taught Zen, much like the Chinese language itself was used.  \n\nAs people became familiar with Zen, Zen Masters developed their own culture and most of the Daoist and Buddhist references and language faded away while some of the language and references became part of Zen culture, much like the \"influence\" of Greek and Latin on the English language.\n\nHistorias often make the mistake of thinking that Zen has something to do with Buddhism and Daoism because of similarities of words and references, even though Zen Masters said, \"outside of words and sentences\".  Even though Zen Masters said that the \"Dharma\" (Law) that they were talking about was not what the Buddhists of the time believed or what the Daoist texts talk about, historians sometimes misunderstand anyway, because most historians are looking for Zen inside words and sentences.\n\nZen Masters, not relying on words and sentences, have remarkable differences in language, references, and style between them.  Early Zen teachings and Zen teachings from a few hundred years later can sound very different, as if the Zen teaching changed very rapidly.  There was no change, but this is often confusing to historians.  For example, historians had a theory that Zen dialogue \"evolved\" in the tradition.  Then some old manuscripts were found from around Bodhidharma's time that had Zen dialogues in them, so the \"evolved\" theory of Zen dialogues turned out to be historically inaccurate.\n\nIt is interesting to note that religions like the Buddhisms and Christianity cling to the authority of specific sacred figures and texts and \"saints\" like Augustine or Dogen or the Dalai Lama.  Religions try to maintain this authority by repeating themselves from one generation to the next.  In contrast, Zen Masters  were not concerned with maintaining authority or with anything or anyone being sacred, thus Zen Masters are all different sorts of teachers just like each person is different from the next.\n\nWhat I am saying here is controversial, especially among religious people and historians.  [Here](http://www.reddit.com/r/zen/wiki/lineagetexts) is a list of some of the records and texts of Zen Masters, you can look it over and decide for yourself.""Zen is not found in not seeking or seeking, in having no goal or in having one... thus \"zen contentment\" does not refer to Zen at all.  There is such a contentment in some forms of Buddhism... I've been told.""What do you mean by \"Buddhism\"?  If you mean \"Take the Buddha's word for it\" then that would be religion... taking someone's word for it is not evidence.\n\nIf you mean, \"We can save other people once we attain a purity that arises from special practices\" then that would be religion... confidence is something without evidence, without personal realization of this purity.\n\nThere are lots of different versions of this conversation but they all boil down to believing someone about something... and then we come to Mazu and his family of charlatans!  A monk asks him, \"Why do you teach the Mind is the Buddha?\"  \n\nTo stop the baby crying.\n\nAnd if the baby stops?\n\nThe Mind is not the Buddha.\n\nIs there anything else?\n\nI will tell you... it is not something.\n\nHa!  Who is it that ever put there trust in Mazu?  Bahizhang, who's nose got twisted for it?\n\n[Mazu was asked](http://www.reddit.com/r/zen/comments/1jqovp/bow_down/), \"What is the meaning of Bodhidharma coming from the West?\"  and Mazu answered, \"Bow Down!\"  and when the monk went to bow down, Mazu kicked him.  \n\nBow Down!\n\nThere is no religion in this family!""Confidence of something without evidence of it.""Mumon appears to be translated fairly consistently... there are however a number of translations that have commentaries by various religious people, who, while often well educated, mix in plenty of their faith in their comments.\n\nThe gold standard for Mumonkan commentary is Blyth's.  You can get it used at [abebooks](http://www.abebooks.com/servlet/SearchResults?an=Blyth&amp;kn=Mumonkan&amp;sts=t) or sometimes at Amazon and prices fluctuate.""There are people who teach something besides what is found in Mumon or Joshu or Huangbo or Tung-Shan, that might very well be religion.\n\nHakamaya and I agree that Dogen teaches religion, and that religion is based in part on an interpretation of Buddhist sutras.  Dogen's people often refer to their teachings as \"religion\" and they often use the word \"Zen\".  Hakamaya and I also agree that Mumon does not fit into this religious view...""I don't disagree with that... I'm suggesting that the \"more information\" come from \"Zen Masters\"... those people that everyone points to when they say \"Zen\"... those people that everyone claims to be in the lineage of... those people who said and wrote down what they thought was most relevent to this converation.""I blame myself.  Sometimes in the Zen tradition the language \"understand this matter\" is used in the context of \"teaching\".  \n\nOther than seeing there is nothing to understand, other than \"this matter\" there is nothing to be taught.""Why not read what they taught?\n\nMumon and Foyan wrote books... why ask a historian rather than start with the Masters themselves?""Do you mean Zen related or other sorts of books?  Before I forget I should always suggest *In Ghostly Japan* by Hearn and *A History of the World In 100 Objects*.  There isn't much about Zen in the Hearn book and even less in 100 Objects, but they are both awesome.\n\nMumonkan and Instant Zen (Cleary's translation of Foyan's text) are books written by Zen Masters, The Sayings of Zen Master Joshu is the funny book.""No \"wrong\".  \n\nIf someone says to you, \"I had a lemon,\" and you ask, \"Where did you get it?\" and they say, \"I got it at a store\" and then you ask, \"What part of the store?\" and they say, \"The lemon part of the store\" then you might think they were telling you about a lemon they heard of, but did not eat themselves.\n\nIt's not that there aren't lemons in stores.  Thus, no \"wrong path.\"""My point is this: If you read the book and gained something, that is not Zen.  If you read the book and didn't gain anything, that is not Zen either.\n\nThose who see into this matter can answer when asked.""You say \"meditation does not equal quietism\" but what do you base this on?\n\nWhen you read \"unifying and pacifying the mind\" what practice do you think this refers to?\n\nWhen Foyan says that people misunderstand meditation and should just \"sit for a few minutes\" how can that be explained any differently?\n\nI'm not encouraging you to take my word for it, I'm saying that there is nobody more \"qualified\" than you are.  You have to develop this understanding for yourself. \n\nBankei went to monks who claimed to teach Zen and they told him to do zazen.  After his enlightenment, when he went looking for people to talk to about it, the monks he met admitted that there were no Masters around in those days.\n\nWhether or not you can find a Master you will still have to see for yourself.  There is no other opinion than yours for you to rely on.""Joshu is found meditating in his quarters in his text.  Why doesn't he talk about it more?\n\nIf your understanding of conceptual thinking is the same as Huangbo's understanding, why doesn't he talk more about sitting meditation, but instead echos the 3P on the problem of quietude?\n\nIt isn't that meditation isn't Zen, it is that there is nothing in particular that is Zen.  \n\nIn record after record of the Masters, people come to discuss this matter with these old men.  Again and again the conversation doesn't get around to sitting meditation.  Why is that?""When what you do or don't do requires no resolve and has no movement, then \"pretend\" is forgotten about.""I don't see anything but you waving your hands around.""It is gossipy tradition of Patriarchs and Buddhas.\n\n&gt; A monk asked, \"The whole assembly has gathered, surely you will say something to us?\n&gt;\n&gt; The master [Joshu] said, \"Today, drag a tree over here and build the monk's hall with it.\"\n&gt;\n&gt; The monk said, \"This is your instruction to us, isn't it?\"\n&gt;\n&gt; The master said, \"I don't know anything about backgammon or long journey [popular games of the time.]\n\nand\n\n&gt; A monk asked, \"What about when people of the Way meet each other?\"\n&gt;\n&gt; The master said, \"Bring out the lacquer bowls.\"\n\nDo you think they would eat in silence?  Ha!  What do they say to each other over and over when one visits the other?  \"What does so-and-so teach?\"""There is a wide variety of things which impress people.\n\nFor instance, I'm impressed that someone made tea.""I was going along with you right up until you started with the \"you\" \"you\" you\".\n\nEverything you said about meditation is true and this is why I recommend it to people.  It is good exercise.  Lots of data to support that.  It is just that learning to \"deal\" with the conceptual running mind has nothing to do with Zen.\n\nMumon goes to all this trouble to say, \"Unifying and pacifying the mind is Quietism, and false Zen.\"  Why?\n\nHui-neng writes a poem about how sitting meditation is for dead people... why?\n\nThe 3P says \"When you try to stop activity to achieve quietude, your very effort fills you with activity.\"  Huangbo repeats this.  Who are they talking to?\n\nJoshu, Tung-shan and Ummon all go out of their way to discuss \"practice\" and do not say what Dogen says.  Why is that?\n\nFoyan says that meditation is misunderstood, but that it is good to sit on a bench \"for a few minutes\" to clear your mind before you study Zen.  Why does he bring this up?\n\nBankei sits until he coughs up blood, then he goes on sitting.  When he begins to teach, he says that such sitting is a waste of time and that there isn't much Zen in Japan.  Was he confused?\n\nIn this family there have been many warnings against the sort of belief that people build up around a useful and healthy exercise.  People have been building up this belief since before Bodhidharma said, \"Void\" and \"Nothing Holy Therein.\"\n\nSitting can be an exercise and an opportunity for concentration.  It has nothing to do with \"Buddha nature\", it isn't any kind of \"practice\", it's like pushups or jump rope.  I don't object to it at all.  I point out that believing that it is \"special\" is not Zen.\n\nAs for Huangbo, who knows what he was thinking?  His teacher's teacher tried to make a brick out of a mirror by sitting.  Maybe Huangbo was just expressing his thanks.""Agreed.""Agreed.\n\nThis is why when I pick up a book with Zen in the title and I don't see much of blah blah of this family, it is not really Zen.  In this family they love to gossip about one another's words.  They don't stop laughing over how funny they think they are.  To be fair, they are very funny.\n\nIn the Yunmen (I should post it) is a story about how Yunmen sent someone to speak for him and the Master said to the proxy monk, \"Those aren't your words.\"  It is like a signature of the same name in a hundred different hands; for those who know the name, impossible to miss.\n""He doesn't think you can refuse, you don't think he can demand.\n\nI don't see any difference between the two of you.""All pointing is the same, there is no \"away\" and no \"at\".  \n\nIf the pointing is recognized even one time then there is no \"try\", there is only the freedom arising from seeing.\n\n""I'm interested in where to opposition comes from.  Your father is controlling in that he wants you to do things... how are you not controlling in that you don't want to do them?""The big picture question is how much variance from your translation will we find text to text or translator to translator?\n\nI was thumbing through the Bodhidharma Anthology and the author was talking about how Zen Masters use common expressions and how this was revolutionary in it's own small way.  ""This is my point about your claim about the book.""Not meat.""Ah!  Ah ha!\n\nBut what *do you put it on*?""Disagree.\n\nIt doesn't matter who you are talking to.  Why argue over who eats the rice?\n\nWhoever is hungry.""Huangbo said not outside or inside or in the middle.""Hmmm.  I was referring to water's \"perfect repose.\"  \n\nWhat do you have for that?""A custom is not wearing your shoes in the house because it keeps the floors clean.\n\nSitting isn't a custom, it's a practice.""That isn't a claim.  But claiming it is a claim disqualifies it.""Probably not.  Somebody told me once that people put his name on everything.""Claiming to be a cow.""\"Which\".""Some people believe that.\n\nI'll reconsider when I meet someone who practices breakfast.""\"perfect\".""You may incur roaming charges.""Mumon did.  What more are you looking for?""A chicken in every pot.""\"Needed\" \"99\" and \"0\" \"you\".  Can you say something that isn't a claim?\n\nWhat I am saying about what you said is observation.  What you believe about what you taught yourself to believe, that is a claim.""No refunds.\n\n""No blood, no foul.""As of when?  You keep adding to them.\n\nYou believe you were taught something, but all of it was you teaching yourself to believe you were taught something.  Not Zen.""\"Why don't you call yourself livestock\" is adds something that was missing.""Noted.\n\nIf we can find someone with insight into either Taiwanese or Japanese Zen scholarship then we'd be bucks up... with the caveat that all the scholarship from Soto that I've seen is Dogen-centered and less reliable on everything else.  \n\nThere is bucket loads of stuff on thezensite.com that I haven't read through... and they are getting that stuff from somewhere/somewho.""Confucius is not Zen.\n\n&gt; \"When standing still the water is in the most perfect state of repose.\"\n\nEvery piece of meat is the best.""I'm not sure that the Chinese have any reliable modern scholarship... when you kill off all your teachers, intellectuals and college graduates and then impose massive restrictions on freedom of speech, your bound to get a lull.  They appeared to hand out Tun huang texts to foreigners like party favors... that is just insanity.\n\nThe Japanese may have someone equal to Blyth (he was living in Japan with a Japanese wife when he wrote... he was published by a Japanese publisher (which is why it's hard to find him in print)... there may have been someone in the last 50 years to rival him... but the Japanese don't have much interest in translating their work into English...""As far as the history of the lineage, Blyth's series is the authority.\n\nFerguson's *Zen's Chinese Heritage* is widely quoted but it is incomplete and unreliable when it comes to Zen Masters and includes lots of questionable speculation and unreliable sources.\n\n\"Relying on faith\" is having confidence in a particular method or practice.  Anything may be a path, but there is no particular method or practice that is, intrinsically, a path.  \"Thousand paths, one Way.\"  A Master can teach any sort of path, people of faith can only teach what they believe is true, truer, or truest.""Nobody ever asks this about eating breakfast.  That's the clue, right there.""Ah, yes.  To seek always big idiot indeed.\n\nTry to tell the young people of today that, and they won't believe you.\n""Blyth chose it as one of the few occasions that he would comment on those who say \"Zen\" but instead rely on faith.\n\nI haven't found a Westerner that has anything like his affection for the Zen lineage, so I'm curious about why he chose it and where it comes from.  It also appears on the cover of the Bodhidharma Anthology, possibly as a coincidence.\n""Interesting claim.\n\nSince you do not appear to have understood Goso, such a claim is merely pretty, like a sunset.""Today's Google Translate is one of the great entertainment values of the internet.  It will be next to impossible to explain this to generations to come who will undoubtedly have a Google Translate that performs so much more effectively that our accounts of the old days will sound like the babbling of idiots.""If you come across [this painting or the text](http://notzenblahblah.blogspot.com/2013/03/daruma-bodhidharma-goes-from-west-to.html) let me know.  I mentioned it to you before I think, it's from the beginning of Blyth's four volume series on the Zen Masters.  It constitutes one of the rare examples of him acknowledging that there is more than one view of these old men.\n\nHis four volumes are remarkably detailed in tracing the lineage, both in inclusions and the omissions.""I haven't read wikipedia.  I have read several versions of the Platform Sutra, however.\n\nThus I have to question the integrity of your wikipedia.\n\nThere are, to be fair, a number of those who do not understand this matter but claim to teach it.  Many of these, not understanding this matter, can only teach sitting meditation and, as Foyan put it, recognizing the original mind... because they have no answers these 'teachers' see everything as sitting meditation and the original mind.\n\nAgain, all I have to offer you is the Platform Sutra.  Red Pine's is particularly full of footnotes.""That's true of sunsets too.\n\nPerhaps you read a book about sunsets and misconstrued.\n\nHow is it that you know it was a book about Zen?""Having learned all you need to know, surely you can say a few words about it...""From my point of view I wander around knocking on doors to see what they teach (believe) there.  I'm curious about whatever happens to be around.  Some people say \"Zen\" but when I ask them about it they talk about compassion and freeing all sentient beings and attaining enlightenment.  When I encounter people who say \"Buddhism, but not like those guys over there\" then I ask them how they are different... and sometimes they can't say for sure, but they *are*.  \n\nThis is what makes Hakamaya interesting, even given his disdain for Suzuki.  Hakamaya can say exactly how different.  Suzuki and Blyth are interesting in a different way... they like to talk about the old men, but they are very shy about saying \"different\".""I can take a crack at putting the doctrinal disputes in terms of wisdom rather than knowledge.\n\n1.  Secular Buddhism - The Sutras as they were written not as they have been interpreted since then, valuable as a tool of wisdom for improving the lives of people today, right now, in every walk of life.\n\n2.  Hakamaya's Soto - Dogen's later works and the relevant sutras, valuable as a tool in improving the lives of people through the practice of manifesting the Buddha nature through zazen in order to attain realization and the salvation of all sentient beings.\n\n3.  Religious Buddhisms - Divinities, traditions, rituals and practices associated with the attainment of enlightenment, the saving of sentient beings, the manifestation of virtues and the elimination of evils.\n\nI was looking over the wikipedia page on [Buddhism in the U.S.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Buddhism) and it is interesting but not necessarily informative... although it illustrates how little I know about all this Buddhism business... I would be lucky to get half the questions right in a test on this page.""You left off the best part:\n\n&gt; \"The Sixth Patriarch's definition of zazen is therefore the same as that of Dogen's.\"\n\nI emailed Hakamaya and we both looked over our copies of Red Pine's Platform Sutra, scratching our heads in stunned disbelief that we could not find \"Zazen\" in the text.""Are you certain?  What about the benefit to other people [of being beaten by Yunmen]?""I'm not sure the Secular Buddhists would agree.  My reading of their position might be better stated, \"personal versus political\" divide.  In that Buddhism is defined in the East by practices, rituals, and monastic culture, it can be said to be a political activity.  Indeed, as an example, Soto has had a bumpy political road of it when the church has taken official positions on matters of political morality only to recant them decades later.  That churches leaders have such a voice or believe they can use it in this way is one of the points of contention.\n\nTo the Secular Buddhists this formulaic and authoritarian politicizing of the religion is a corruption of the deeply personal and religious nature of Buddhism (for them), much like Luther's rejection of Catholicism via the 95 theses.\n\nFurther, Hakamaya's rejection of Zen as non-Dogen non-Buddhism is based on the defining elements of Dogen's Buddhism (in his view).  Rather than grouping \"Dharma\" schools together under one roof, Hakamaya looks at the context and usage of \"Dharma\" and concludes that these schools are incompatible despite using some of the same words and phrases.\n\nIn both Secular Buddhism and Critical Buddhism the effort is being made to identify the unique elements of particular Buddha Dharmas and this has had the effect of making \"Buddhism\" an unusable concept, not as an anthropological exercise, but as a statement of essence of the faith.""I think the essence of Peacock's dispute over \"ism\" of Buddhism is much like lumping those non-deity Wiccans in with the other atheisms.  Many atheists see the category as a sort of realism.  So when Peacock and the other secular Buddhists complain about \"Buddhism\" it is because they don't want to be lumped in with the religiosity of many those who pray to Buddha or otherwise treat him as something other than a nice guy who helped people get along.""Peacock's history of the word Buddhism is that a travel writer is wandering around in the East in the early 1800's and hears people saying \"Buddha Dharma\" and \"Dharma\" all the time and assumes they are all talking about the same thing, when, as it turns out, people rarely are.\n\nGiven the wide range of interpretations and preferences for one text over another, let alone the odd additions of the Bodhidharma lineage, there is no single meaning of \"Buddha Dharma\" or \"Dharma\" in use.  \n\nIf one wanders into churches throughout the U.S. listening to sermons there is a wide variety of views on \"God\", so much so that any one definition of God, especially in the context of what \"God\" values and how \"God\" acts and what \"God\" expects, cannot be reconciled with any other definition of God.\n\nThe \"Buddha\" that Yunmen sees in a dry shit stick, the Buddha that Yunmen would have beaten to death under the tree, the \"Buddha\" that Joshu says he doesn't like to hear, these represent a view and a definition of \"Buddha\" incompatible with Buddhism's sacred figure.\n\nThus Buddha and Buddha Dharma are homonyms in Zen, words that sound the same but mean something different than their cousins in the sacred texts of religions who chant the name in order to obtain salvation.""There is an entire section in the Yunmen text given to conversations where Yunmen answers for other people... and that's not the only section where he answers for other people.\n\nNot being able to answer is a common phenomena in students of Zen.  The dialogues of other Masters often feature \"the monk said nothing.\"""Also Ra seems quite preoccupied with it's own name.\n\nLike maybe it's a computer from an old episode of Star Trek that believes itself to be a deity and governs a savage and regressive populace that has forgotten it's history.\n\nWhich brings me to another topic, that of aliens.  Stories about alien races always focus on the most ridiculous elements of conversation.  I know what we are going to talk about when we meet: *Euclidean geometry.*\n\n""There are lots of people who say things like \"cannot be spoken\".  Then they go on an on about it.\n\nZen Masters say \"cannot be spoken\" and then they beat people and run them out of the temple.""Agreed.""Since it is commonly considered that Bodhidharma wrote Two Entrances and the Lanka (didn't it come from the oral tradition) is of dubious authorship, you are just talking Buddhism.\n\nWhether there was anybody name Bodhidharma that wrote Two Entrances is beside the point, really.  The lineage of Bodhidharma certainly read Two Entrances, Master Yuan certainly had read it, the Third Patriarch read it... the text itself is a starting point, as is the name Bodhidharma.\n\nYou can no more tie Zen to Buddhism then you can tie the Pieh Chi dialogue to Buddha.  When you say \"Buddha\" and \"Buddha Dharma\", you are using Buddhist homonyms, not the words that Zen Masters use.\n\n""Ah.  What if I ask you this:\n\nWould it have been of much interest to Bankei or Mumon or Huangbo what sort of components they had, whether alien beings in a hive mind or brain cells running on top of a collection of organs and microorganisms?  Those sorts of conversations are for entertainment value, having nothing to do with Freedom arising from seeing.\n\n&gt;  The offering of self to Creator is the greatest service, the unity, the fountainhead. \n\nNot Zen.  No creator, nothing created.  Thus no service.  If you can see with the eyes of the old men, how much more unity is even worth mentioning?\n\n""As a general point in this conversation I point out that Zen Masters quote lots of things, sometimes altering the quote subtly, sometimes not.  That Zen Masters quote things should not be construed as evidence of some sort of parallel between Zen and something else, or between Ra and Zen for example.  \"The difference of even by a single hair is the distance between heaven and earth\" or something like that.\n\nPeople can imagine lots of things about a lemon.  For example, it is yellow, or so we are told.  That someone says of something, \"It is yellow!\" does not even suggest a similarity to a lemon, for example, a photograph of a lemon.\n\nThe taste of a lemon is unmistakable, and, itself, is nothing to do with the color or shape of a lemon.""When one can't tell the difference between history and religion, how can one understand the Lanka that the Buddhists worship and he Lanka that is the mind essence?\n\nIn Two Entrances, Bodhidharma sets down the foundation of his lineage.  This foundation is no different from his reading of the Lanka, and thus is no different than what Joshu and Foyan taught.  Thus every Master expounds the foundation, the Lanka is no different than Gutei's finger, and those who say silly things like \"entirely bauddha\" have no understanding of even one \"Mu\".\n\nFor this reason Masters who quoted the Lanka were rewriting the sutras as Joshu taught, and those who said, as Huangbo did, that there was no basis for Zen teachings were, in fact, quoting the Lanka as Bodhidharma read it.""Noted.  \n\nHow about \"Your reference to my quotes in the context of Rockytimber's questions are not necessarily the questions either you or Rockytimber is asking, if these are even the same questions, which is why I asked you some clarifying questions about your questions, asked as they were in the context of Rockytimber's questions.\"\n\nWho's on first is right around the corner.""Increasingly, at least in Japan, and at least to scholars of Dogen, we have to identify Dogen quotes by \"early Dogen\" and \"late(r) Dogen\".  The early versions of Dogen's Shobogenzo are increasingly recognized as the work of more than one author, so \"quoting Dogen\" is not strictly accurate when discussing the early works.\n\nWhat I've read suggests that the Soto school used the first multiple author Dogen Shobogenzo to bring together different groups, some of which were Zen students, and so Zen references, quotes, and talk were included to cement their relationship.  This Zen material does not necessarily survive in Dogen's Shobogenzo 2.0, which is thought to be completely his own.""This is a history based on the random luck of historians and archeologists, having little to do with what Zen Masters had to say about it.\n\nAs far as that goes, Two Entrances and Faith in Mind, I glanced over them and they don't appear to use the word \"dhyana\".  Hui-neng used it, and it was used to describe Hui-neng's school.  \n\nWhether the 4th, 5th or 6th Patriarch chose the name \"Zen\" or were given it, how does that matter?\n\nThat other people before Bodhidharma may have chosen or been given the name, how does that matter to Bodhidharma?\n\nBy Hui-neng's time there was no confusion over what and who the \"Zen\" name referred to, and to this day that certainty continues.\n\nAs for the ongoing religious insistence on the undefined term \"Buddhism\", the Bodhidharma lineage did not use it themselves.  The lineage held the view that others who invoked the name \"Buddha\" were mistaken in their views.  Thus there can be no association between Bodhidharma's lineage an any of the religions now called \"Buddhism\" in the West.""Your question in the context of those quotes is not necessarily the question you might have intended to ask... that is why I asked you some clarifying questions.""I think I understand your point.\n\nTell me, those that Huangbo mocked and rejected, were they in his imagination?\n\nThe head monk that Tung-Shan questioned to death, was he an imaginary head monk?\n\nThe chapter that Foyan devotes to ridiculing those \"teachers\" who claim to teach Zen but have not been enlightened, does he imagine those?\n\nAfter Bankei finished spitting up blood, when he exposed the culture of those pretending to understand Zen who were only mouthing words and practicing sitting meditation, was that in his imagination?\n\nWhen Hui-neng supposedly fled for his life at the direction of his teacher, was that in his imagination?\n\nWhen ZhaoZhou scorned one hermit but not the other, when he investigated the old woman, when he embarrassed questioner after questioner with his distaste for beliefs and practices, where all those people in his imagination?\n\nEven if I am a deluded fool (how could I prove otherwise?) don't be mistaken about Zen and those who teach it; they are intolerant, judgemental, and without any gentleness regarding those who belive in the value of sacred words and practices.\n\nYunmen said once that if he had been there when Buddha was enlightened under the tree he would have *beaten him to death with his staff.*\n\nWhat a joker!""People who invest in religion aren't known for tolerating hard questions.\n\nPlus, you know, I'm irritating and stuff.""Disagree.  It is not accurate to say that anybody who quotes something is religious about the quote.  When someone quotes a sutra because they believe that it contains some truth, some element of the transmission, then that is religion and not Zen.\n\nOutside of words and sentences means \"not in the sutras\" and \"not in the words of the Patriarchs and the Masters.\"\n\nYunmen refers occasionally to questions and answers that are outside the words of the tradition.  Why?  Because Zen is not inside or outside the words of the tradition.\n\nWhy is it that if you count the sentences in all the texts of all the Zen Masters only a fraction of these sentences refer to the sutras?  Why do Zen Masters talk about ordinary everyday things, rice, staves, gates, eating, sleeping, more than the sutras?  \n\nWe do not disagree that the Masters talk about the sutras.  They talk about lots of things.  They don't believe in anything that they say as a means to enlightenment, or as particularly true or particularly false.\n\n&gt; Therefore, saying that there is no Dharma to be explained in words is called preaching the Dharma.\n\nThe sutras are just words.\n\n&gt; Above all it is essential not to select some particular teaching suited to a certain occasion, and, being impressed by its forming part of the written canon, regard it as an immutable concept.\n\n\"Written canon\" includes the sutras.\n\n&gt; Q: Upon what Dharma principles does Your Reverence base these words?\n&gt;\n&gt; A: Why seek a doctrine?  As soon as you have a doctrine, you fall into dualistic thought.\n\nThus *there is no basis for Huangbo's teaching*.  There is no doctrine that supports it.  There is no authority in the sutras, or anywhere else.\n\nI encourage you to read Huangbo.  These quotes are all from Huangbo.  If you like I can dance the same jig with Mazu or ZhaoZhou or Dongshan or Wumen or Yunmen or Foyan.\n\nWhile we are on the topic perhaps you would care to give your opinion on the passage below.  We don't get to talk about this sort of thing because of all the discussion of religion.\n\n&gt; Q: Surely the void stretching out in front of our eyes is objective.  Then aren't you pointing to something objective and seeing Mind in it?\n&gt;\n&gt;A: What sort of mind could I tell you to see in an objective environment?  Even if you could see it, it would only be Mind reflected in an objective sphere.  You would be like a man looking at his face in a mirror; though you could distinguish your features clearly, you would still be looking at a mere reflection.  What bearing has this on the affair that brought you to me?\n&gt;\n&gt;Q: If we do not see by means of reflections, when shall we see at all?\n&gt;\n&gt; A: So long as you are concerned with \"by means of\", you will always be depending on something false.\n\nThere is no reflection of this Mind.  It is not in sitting meditation, it is not in sutras.  It is not outside of sitting meditation, it is not absent from sutras.\n\nMazu: \"This very mind that does not understand is it, there is no other thing.\"\n\nNote that he did not say anything about sutras or noses or candles or sitting meditation or practices of any kind or the words of the Buddhas and the Patriarchs.  \"No other thing\" means \"NO OTHER THING.\"\n""Disagree.\n\nHui-neng was enlightened after hearing a piece of a sutra in a public square.  Hyakujo was enlightened when his nose was twisted.  Tokusan was enlightened when his candle was blown out.  \n\nThere is no \"clarity\" in any of these.  Claiming that a sutra explains more than a nose twist or a guttering candle is Buddhism, not Zen.\n\nClaiming the sutras explain \"more than\" or even something at all, that's Buddhism, not Zen.  Zen Masters didn't explain.  They pointed.  They pointed with candles and nose twists and sutras.  They didn't believe in candles or nose twists or sutras.\n\nThose who teach sutras are not Zen.  Who teaches \"nose twists\"?  Not even the Masters.""I don't know anyone's mind, I only know what the words they write say.\n\nSomebody just said trust in the Dharma... that's Buddhism.\n\nMy only claims are based on what Zen Masters said.  They rejected so many things, mocked so many people, that we can talk about what they said for a long time without finding anything they agreed to.\n\nWhen people say that \"Zen is\", that isn't found in the text.  When they elevate Buddha's teaching above the ordinary mind and casual talk of Zen Masters, then I call that Buddhism.  \n\nI don't say that putting something above the Zen Masters is wrong, I just say that when Buddha is put there, that is not Zen, when meditation is put there, that is not Zen, when people claim enlightened \"special\" understanding of the texts, that is not Zen.\n\nPeople who believe in something and call it Zen are claiming to speak for the Zen Masters.  They can speak for themselves.""I'm suggesting that a) I haven't found any discussion of how it was used in sanskrit; b) I haven't found any Chinese characters in Zen texts that reference \"bauddha\" or anything like it.\n\nSo, it's worth following up on, but it is by no means a basis for a system of government.""Why not both?\n\nI don't really follow your argument.  You object as if somehow objecting was all the substance that was required.""This \"Bauddha\" argument is interesting, but so far a) Not found in the Zen texts; b) not mentioned in any of the sanskrit discussions I've found; c) therefore not an argument yet, just a theory.  An interesting theory though.  \n\nComing along after your belief and tacking \"bauddha\" on there isn't a discussion, it's closing the barn door after an imaginary horse has run off.\n\nZen Masters don't preach the sutras often enough for you to confuse Zen with Buddhism.  Lots of people read sutras.  The secular Buddhists read sutras.  \n\n\"You never\" and \"you think\" is just you, preaching your faith.  I point out the words don't always say what you believe and you have no answer except \"you never\" and \"you think\".""Writing \"Zen + Buddhism\" on your highschool notebook isn't an argument... it's a statement of faith.\n""No, not \"ewk\".  But no \"Buddhism\" anywhere around, since they never said it or taught it.""I'm saying that he doesn't agree with you all the time, which, to him, is the same as him never agreeing with you.  They all said that.\n\nI'm saying that you have a pot, and it may be black, but it isn't a kettle.  Similar is not close enough, even one hair is the difference between heaven and earth.\n\n""So, you can't tell Zen from Buddhism, but you can categorize people?  You don't know the difference between faith and Freedom arising from seeing, but you do know the difference between truth and nonsense?\n\nInteresting claims.""You came in through the door with \"Zen\" written above it.  Then you preached you faith.  Whenever I answer you with what the old men said, the only answer you have is to suggest I have a mental disorder or that I am a fanatic.\n\nIf you stop preaching your faith in this house of the old men, what will I have to object to?  Which is the fanatic, the one who knows which house it is or the one who pretends to be in their own home when visiting the neighbor's house?\n\n""I agree that you are continuing to expound your faith.  \"We better rely on the Dharma\" is Buddhism, no argument.\n\nThere is nothing to rely on in Zen.  VOID and NOTHING HOLY THEREIN.  You are playing the Emperor and I am playing Bodhidharma, but you believe in your role and I am just a puppet.\n\nYou believe the rain is giving you a lecture.  Foyan taught that the rain doesn't lecture anyone.  You are a Buddhist, Foyan is a Zen Master.\n\nI call it \"religion\" because that's what it is.  I call apples by the name \"apples\" and lemons by their name.  What Zen Masters taught is called \"Zen\" and this is their house, with their name above their door.\n\nYou professed a belief in a Dharma.  That is not Zen.\n\n&gt; You do not see that THE FUNDAMENTAL DOCTRINE OF THE DHARMA IS THAT THERE ARE NO DHARMAS, YET THAT THIS DOCTRINE OF NO-DHARMA IS IN ITSELF A DHARMA; AND NOW THAT THE NO-DHARMA DOCTRINE HAS BEEN TRANSMITTED, HOW CAN THE DOCTRINE OF THE DHARMA BE A DHARMA?  Whoever understands the meaning of this deserves to be called a monk, one skilled at 'Dharma practice'.  If you do not believe this, you must explain [Hui-neng's teaching to Wei Ming on the mountain top].""Hakamaya's argument includes the view that Dogen's early works are the result of several contributors, many of whom studied Zen, and that the early work was meant as a tool for inclusion to bring various views under the Soto roof.  Dogen's later work is only by him, and no such inclusion is attempted.\n\nFurther, the reconciliation of different views is generally avoided in all the religions.  \"Different fingers, same moon\" as our guest suggests is how the Old Testament and the New Testament ended up in one Bible... a coherent view is not necessary in a church... and may be an impediment to large congregations.""When I eat a cracker, I eat a cracker.  On Sundays there are many who go to church and eat a cracker, but it is not the same cracker I eat.\n\nIf someone says that sutras contain more wisdom than a cracker, that's religion and not Zen.  If a Zen Master preaches about eating rice, it's just rice.\n\nFor you to pretend that the Catholic Cracker or the Buddhist Sutra are not distinct from a bowl of rice is ridiculous.  If these was no distinction then sometimes there would be no crackers and no sutras.\n\nWhen a modern soto priest \"does it\", they believe in what they are doing, that's why they do it.  When Zen Masters quote the sutras or their family or themselves there is no belief in there.\n\nThat you would accuse me of bigotry because I don't share your faith is... ironic.""Agreed.  That is your faith.  Such a faith is not Zen.\n\nWould you like me to point you to the Masters who have explained this to you?  Would you accept their negation of your faith if I did?""You can say \"baseless\", I will continue to point you to the base.\n\n1.  \"Buddhism\" is a word that the West invented in the early 1800's.  Zen Masters didn't have such a word, and such a word is taxonomically impossible, like \"manfish\".\n\n2.  No, I mean homonyms.  \"Buddha Dharma\" does not mean the same thing when you say as when Joshu says it.  You might believe it does, but that is just faith.\n\n3.  Zen Masters studied whatever they liked.  They ate whatever was given to them.  There is no \"Zen Diet\".\n\n4.  I don't take this quote to mean anything.  You seem to believe you understand it, you take it to mean something, but when I ask you for even one word of Zen all you have to offer is your belief that you have experienced enlightenment.  Such a claim is binding yourself in chains.""The consistency you ask for is *precisely the inconsistency you refuse to read for yourself.*\n\nI've posted Yunmen that you might want to reread.\n\nThe conversation about the sutras is the same conversation about Dogen's meditation.  It is not that the sutras and meditation are somehow intrinsically \"not Zen\", not at all.\n\nThose people who believe the sutras are *more intrinsic* then a candle or a nose twist, those people who believe that \"Zazen is Zen\", these are Buddhists, not Zen.\n\nZen Masters teach with whatever people bring them.  Buddhists who come to Zen Masters sometimes get sutras, sometimes not.  It is precisely these occasions of \"sometimes not\" that cast the sutras down from a throne of religious authority and into the morass of ordinary where Zen Masters putter around.\n\nIs this coherent enough for you?  VOID AND NOTHING HOLY THEREIN.\n\nThis doesn't mean \"no sutras or meditation\"... it means that those who believe that sutras or meditation are \"special\" are not teaching Zen.\n\nI don't hesitate in quoting Jesus to Christians who ask me about Zen, but I am not a Christian.  I don't hesitate in quoting Buddha to Buddhists who ask me about Zen, but I am not a Buddhist.  To those who believe in Taoism, I don't hesitate in quoting Chung Tze and Lao tze in preaching the Dharma of no Dharma to them.\n\nDo not convince yourself that I have a dogma of \"only this\" or \"only that\".  Zen Masters taught however they liked.  But what they taught, this was not Buddhism, not Dogen's zazen, not the Northern School's dhyana and not Quietism.\n\nThere is no \"by means of\" in Zen, no attachment to teachings.""How can I kick him out?  He said it was nonsense too.\n\nThose who cling to sutras skip over his comments about the useless of sutras.  It is as if they can only hear what he says when it seems to confirm them.""People who can't see past religious beliefs have long tried to comfort themselves by convincing themselves that those who disagree are mentally unsound...\n\nZen Masters have been enlightened by candles, nose twists, sutras, yelling, beatings and running water.  This is just a small sample.  To suggest that the sutras are somehow less silly than candles and nose twisting is... religious.\n\nI don't think you are crazy for clinging so tightly to your faith... such clinging is, as Foyan says, living in a black fog.  Your fog is no different than anyone else's here.""This \"Buddhism\" you are talking about is a Western invention.  A long list of those who said \"Buddha Dharma\" is a long list of people who said \"Truth\", it isn't a category - it's a list of homonyms.  Let it go.\n\nThat you would suggest that a list of homonyms is a guide to Joshu, Tung-shan and Mumon is ridiculous.\n\nAs for what the Indians thought of as Buddha Dharmas or the Chinese, I can't make heads or tales of all the dogmas, and those that claim to understand all disavow each other.  \n\nI read Zen Masters.  They claimed each other and they were startlingly clear about their meaning of \"Buddha Dharma\".  I recommend them.""Mumonkan is an interesting example in this regard.  First, it is a written (and numbered) text, so we can be fairly certain that we have the text in it's entirety.  \n\nSecond, it is version of Cases which Mumon has edited as he liked.  \n\nThird, what is in there?  Novices eager to get to grips with this \"Zen\" business will have a rough go of it.  Mumon argues with his ancestors, mocks them, declares them shams and farces, and writes little poems about them that appear to contradict themselves.  \n\nFourth, when Amban comments on the whole Mumonkan business he accuses Mumon of choking novices with too much, he then himself quotes a sutra, rejects the quote, and then resubmits it.  \n\nSo it is not only what Mumon said, but what he quoted, and what was said about it, all of which comes to what?  It is written like a bible, but where are the churches that are built on it?  Impossible.""It is only your own thoughts that concern you and you can only think them by knocking on their door.""You are guilty of something whenever you say \"Ch'an Buddhism\".  This is something only recently invented in the West which a few churches embraced enthusiastically.  It has nothing to do with Zen.  You believe in it but you can't defend it, like any other church doctrine.\n\nZen is the name given to what Bodhidharma's lineage taught.  How can I make any claim about it?  Read Joshu.  There is nothing left out of his words, and anything more than what he said is just church dogma that pretends to be something it cannot teach.""There is no such thing as Zen Buddhism.\n\nChurches say all kinds of things that reasonable people can only scratch their heads at.  This fellow, whatever his church claims to teach, are not of Mumon's family and Joshu's family and Tung-shan's family.\n\nDo you think Mumon and Joshu and Tung-shan could not have preached sutra silliness if they wanted?  That is silly.  They didn't preach it because it isn't Zen, they didn't expound in this manner because it is not Zen.\n\nClaiming the name \"Zen\" doesn't amount to anything.  Any church that claims to speak for Mumon and Joshu and Tung-shan must say at least one word of Zen.""What you call \"Ch'an Buddhism\" is a religion that you can't even make a claim about.  At least Hakamaya understands his own mind well enough to put forth some arguments about his faith.  I ask you for your arguments and all I get is a logical fallacy based on a misuse of the word \"guilt\".  \n\nI read Joshu and Huangbo and Mumon.  There is no \"integral part\" other than what they said.  If it isn't in there, it isn't integral.  You can take your \"real account\" of your \"biographical list\" and try to paste it in the back of Mumonkan or dress it up as a \"Joshu said\" or cut and paste it into a Huangbo lecture, why not?  It is as honest as your claim of \"understood\".""This is Buddhism, not Zen.  When it is not clear to you whether someone is discussing faith or Buddhism, ask yourself, \"Why would I bother with putting into practice what you are saying?\"\n\n&gt; This state in which there is no perception of stillness or movement is Mahayana Samadhi. The ordinary, worldly kind of samadhi is also a kind of stillness. But a practitioner in Mahayana Samadhi is not moved by the environment or by emotions. He has no intention of holding his mind still. There is no intentionality, and there is no movement whatsoever.\n\nAnyone who puts this into practice is acting out of desire.  Just as Dogen's people pretend to do nothing when they engage in sitting, this Buddhist is pretending to do nothing while holding his mind still.  It's no different then when Christians pray to Jesus to help some stranger and pretend they are not asking for themselves.\n\nThe old men in this family didn't hold their minds still when their minds were still, and they didn't have no intentionality when they had no intentionality, this is because they were not attached to anything.  This is not the same as this author's \"Mahayana Samadhi\" because when these old men were moved by the environment they were moved by the environment and when they were moved by emotions they were moved by emotions.  There is no separation with them, there was no going with them, there was no arriving.\n\nYunmen's teacher did not welcome him into the monastery, the story goes.  When Yunmen put his leg into the gap in the gate, his teacher slammed the gate closed and Yunmen's leg was broken.\n\nI have no idea what Buddhists are talking about, but it is not Zen.  Ask them, was Yunmen's teacher moved by environment or emotion when he slammed the gate?  Did he have \"no perception of stillness or movement\" when the he swung the gate so hard that a leg broke under his hand?  These Buddhists are ridiculous.\n\nAll the talking about hearing things is not having heard them.  All the listening is not having listened.  All this paying attention is not having paid attention.  It is not that I am saying that this author is a misguided fool, he was already a misguided fool, it is that I am making a misguided fool of others by explaining what a misguided fool is.  Only a misguided fool would bother with such things.  \n\nPut that into practice.\n\n\n\n""What did they ever talk about besides facts?\n\nWho is it that ever disputed anything they said?\n\nHow is it that anyone knows what is a fact and what isn't?\n\n""Not Zen in fall falls,\n\nNot Zen in winter freezes;\n\njust across the bridge.\n\n""You mix together errors of fact and logic to produce a view that makes itself remarkably irrelevant to the discussion here.  Specifically:\n\n##Defending \"Buddhism\"\nHakkamaya certainly must defend his view, so does anyone who uses the term \"Buddhism\".  Dogen is the basis for Hakamaya's definition of Buddhism, and the Dogen and the sutras are the text for that debate.  Any other definition would have to set forth criteria and choose texts.  Otherwise \"Buddhism\" is a term of faith, not conversation.\n\nYou can argue that Hakamaya has failed in reason or in text, you have done neither.  You can argue that there is a alternate definition, but so far you have not provided it to the standard that Hakamaya has set.\n\n## No Zen Outside the Bodhidharma Lineage\nWhatever the word \"Zen\" refers to, ZhaoZhou and Huangbo and Wumen are at the center of it.  There is no \"Zen\" that excludes them.  These three each specifically reference Bodhidharma as the beginning of whatever this \"Zen\" is, at least in China.  Zen is their name, Bodhidharma their point of origin.  Whatever anyone else has to say about it has nothing to do with Zen.\n\nFurther these three and the rest of this family are always gossiping about each other.  This gossip is an irrevocable tree of it's own.  Whatever anyone else has to say about that is also nothing to do with Zen.\n\nThis family never called itself Buddhist or embraced any family outside of their own in China.  There is no Zen other than their Zen, and no general Buddhism family that they agreed to.\n""While not required for a refutation of Hakamaya's argument, any coherent response to him would have to propose a comprehensive, contrary definition.  Not knowing much about Buddhism, I can't say what role nirvana plays in the religion.\n\nIn Two Entrances and in the Pei chi text that Suzuki sites there aren't any references to the \"other\" Dharmas.  The Emperor koan and several statements by a variety of Masters make it very clear that Zen Masters did not considers themselves members of a larger group, quite the contrary.  Some Masters specifically reject the other Buddha dharmas.\n\nArguing that the use of the word \"Buddha\" or \"dhyana\" is grounds for grouping together different views would be like arguing that use of the word \"god\" conflates ideologies, which of course is nonsense.  The Christians and the Norse are not in any way talking about the same thing.""My asserting is just negating what the Buddhists brought in here... :)""None of that stuff has any particular value in Zen.  Foyan said that koans, sitting meditation, and paying attention were all equal means of working...  I think he would classify Bankei's means as paying attention.\n\nIt is not what is done, it is the Mind that is present.\n\nAgain, this is one of the underlying irreconcilable differences between Zen and anybody who teaches a practice or holds a practice is a manifestation... there is nothing to practice and nothing to manifest... by saying \"manifest\" it is already manifested and (probably) ignored.\n\nBankei's claim that \"nobody has every proved it until now\" is likely a result of his isolation from the lineage and his not having met a Master.""Bankei's account of this is somewhat different.  Also the distinction between Rinzai and Soto is, often, just a matter of spelling.\n\nOne interesting aspect of Bankei's accounts of his contact with the Buddhist-churches-that-say-Zen in Japan at the time is the lack of Masters.  It is not only that those he meets are not Masters, it is also that they haven't met any themselves... and by his account he met lots of people prior to his enlightenment.""I think the \"Fundamentally there is not a single thing\" line gets translated as \"nothing from the first.\"\n\nThere are several translations of this poem (ooh!  Let's have a whole thread of them!) and here is one of D.T. Suzuki's:\n\n&gt; **There is no Bodhi-tree.**\n&gt; \n&gt; **Nor stand of mirror bright.**\n&gt; \n&gt; **Since all is void,**\n&gt; \n&gt; **Where can the dust alight?**\n\nHere is another of Suzuki's, done in an answering way.\n\n|Other guy |Hui-neng|\n|:----------|:----------------|\n|This body is the Bodhi-tree| ***The Bodhi is not like the tree***|          \n|The soul is like a mirror bright| ***The mirror bright is nowhere shining***| \n|Take heed to keep it always clean| ***As there is nothing from the first***|  \n|And let not dust collect on it| ***Where can the dust itself collect?***|   \n\nHere is Blyth's version just for fun:\n\n|Other guy |Hui-neng|\n|:----------|:----------------|\n|The body is the Tree of Salvation,| ***Salvation is nothing like a tree,***|          \n|The mind is a clear mirror.| ***Nor a clean mirror.***| \n|Incessantly wipe and polish it,| ***Essentially, not a \"thing\" exists,***|  \n|Let no dust fall on it.| ***What is there, then, for the dust to fall on?***| \n\nNote the two memes of this family in the Hui-neng poem, negation and questioning.""Oh, and UG isn't from this family.  Perhaps UG will fit in amongst the Dzogchen crowd.  ""According to Bankei's autobiography, he started with Confucius and then expanded to whoever had anything on offer.  Also, according to his autobiography, he didn't take up Zen until after his enlightenment.\n\nThere is no study after enlightenment, just, you know, reading.\n\nI haven't met a teacher who can answer yet.  I had more books available to me then Bankei did, so when I was told to practice by a priest I just wandered along to the next one.""I agree with you about what the monk couldn't smell... but if you can smell it, then how you react is immaterial.  If someone is covered in shit then their words and actions are in accord with that, even if these words and actions are uniquely their own.""U.G. was another thought creationist, although he was light hearted about it.  Of course his view of Zen was more informed by current events then by Zen Masters.  \n\nThere is not one in a thousand that can resolve this matter without meeting a Zen Master.

I only point out that what people claim the lineage says is not supported by what the lineage says.\n\nMany Buddhists believe they are qualified to teach.  Zen Masters don't believe in \"qualified\".  As Foyan said, \"I have no Zen for you to study.  I have no doctrine for you to discuss.\"\n\nThose who read the lineage will see that I have not deceived anyone.

I also point out that the first to point this out was the lineage of Bodhidharma which is famous for it's many varieties of \"not Zen\".  \n\n\"Hoping to accomplish\" and \"flinging mud\" don't have anything to do with me.  Seeing the world in those terms is... not Zen.""I pointed out that your belief in \"the problem\" is the result of you forming concepts.\n\nIn response, you tell me I am not qualified to say anything.

Certainly up through Mumon (and in Bankei) there is a disdain for repeating the expedients of the prior generation... a respect for elders and a recognition of their words, but clearly framed in the context of \"and that's useless now.\"""I haven't read much about it... teachers being naughty, Soto policy covering up war crimes and failing to acknowledge dissent... discrimination and public denial of responsibility for it by church representatives... my understanding is that Soto's political failings were the driving force behind Critical Buddhism... that there is something of a crisis of conscience in the Japanese Soto community, but the Western community/communities are less integrated socially and politically with the culture and thus are less concerned.  \n\nSooner or later somebody who knows about this conversation from the inside will wander in here and explain it.  I can't even find Hakamaya's book in English.""Dhyana is not sitting meditation in sanskrit or chinese... if you try to find \"sitting meditation\" as Dogen's people teach it in the lineage that Dogen claims he got it from... you won't find anything like what Dogen calls zazen.\n\nSo even if we can agree that dhyana is \"cultivation\" is the sanskrit, when we get to Hui-neng it isn't \"cultivation\" anymore.\n\n\"Zazen is cultivation\", as a translation, goes to the very core of the problem that Soto is Buddhism, not Zen.""Where are you getting this Hsu-yun?  Are there texts?  Who is the translator?  What are the titles (in any language)?""Dhyana was translated as \"Zen\" in the early 1800's by people who didn't know much about translation.  D.T. Suzuki wrote a book about Hui-neng's use of the word dhyana and what that compels in translation.  Secular Buddhit Peacock points out that dhyana doesn't mean \"meditation\" because there is no sanskrit use of the word as \"meditation\", it's \"cultivation\" like what gardeners do, not related to sitting quietly.\n\nIn the last decade or so there have been many \"religious\" translations of dhyana made to support a particular view of Zen, but scholars, among them Blofeld and Red Pine, are increasingly leaning away from \"meditation.\"""Agreed... but if we are discussing which of the ten commandments is more important, 1 because it's, well, 1, or 11 because Jesus brought it personally, how do we get to a genuine false premise?  These are articles of faith, and people can believe whatever they like.  All the commandments are made up, right?  And the order.  How are arguments over the \"true order\" of the commandments any different then arguments over which part of the oral tradition made writing made religion attributed to Buddha is eminent?""This is what Bankei was talking about... his dialogues with the Soto monks before and after his enlightenment... first he gets the \"do this\" view, which is then later undermined by the admission that many of them are just adhering to forms and rituals, going through the motions  without any understanding.\n\nThe further problem that emerges is how easy it is for some people to fool themselves into believing that they understand something, especially if they have forms and rituals.  If we were to agree, hypothetically, that all the Abrahamic religions were  based on \"fooling yourself into believing\" then that's most of the planet that has fooled themselves.  It is no big stretch to argue that most of the people who have said \"Zen\" are also fooling themselves.\n\nThe scandals that have shaken Soto appear to be taken much *much* more seriously by the Japanese then by the West... some of which involve the failure of of rituals to express \"right view\" in the face of political expedience.""Agreed, this has nothing to do with the questions I usually ask.\n\nI think that the self v no-self question is what leads Hakamaya to his three criteria, but the three criteria don't depend on it.  If I had his first book I would be speculating less.\n\nOne of the Secular Buddhists, a guy named Peacock, asks this question \"what *is* Buddhism?\" because the word is Western, as far as he knows, as far as I know.  Hakamaya's definition of Buddhism is one of the few attempts to address this problem that I've found so far.  Western scholars have touched on this subject but I haven't found anybody who tackles it.\n\nI think the argument could be made that D.T. Suzuki, Blyth, probably Huangbo, maybe Hui-neng, argued (overtly or by implication) that Zen was \"the true Buddha-Dharma\" in that all the other Buddha-Dharmas rely on beliefs that are nothing to do with (Buddhism) the Buddha-Dharma, but are merely expedients that have not recognized themselves as such.""Fundamental to Zen is this idea that there is no authority.  Certificates, robes, fancy haircuts, none of it matters.\n\nIf you are enlightened, then you can greet a man of the Way.  If you aren't, then you can't.  No piece of paper or fancy robe or 20 years seniority can change that.  A head monk is just somebody who has been around long enough to get the jokes.\n\nSo it is you who is doing the deciding.  It is whoever is greeted, or greets.  It's all you.""I can't decide who is sincere, but you can decide who is classy?\n\n""Ta-chu-hui... fat fingered, or is it fat brained?  I've been looking for that Shobogenzo.  Apparently it is very long.\n\nBased on what I've gleaned of the Hakamaya/Critical Buddhist counter argument, people come at the attribution of authority rather than what Hakamaya concludes about it... I'm not so interested in the various arguments about the authority of this sutra or that one... but about how Hakamaya excludes Zen and how others try to re-include it.""Arahant?  Never heard of him.""I decided your comment wasn't sincere.""Some of these discussions are with people who spend all their time practicing their religion rather than doing the work, and sometimes these conversations lend me the appearance of credibility and deep scholarly insight.  But anyone can appear this credible in similar circumstances, much like discussions about the Bible.  Lots of people run around saying stuff like \"homosexuality is a sin\" but any high school student can actually *read* the bible and seem credible by pointing out that the Bible allows for slavery.""I don't know how far apart geographically ZhaoZhou and Yunmen were and I haven't encountered any mention of them or their students or teachers meeting for generations in either direction...""I disagree with half.""No, no.  My error.  It's \"If an insincere man...\"""Both ZhaoZhou and Yunmen use the phrase, so presumably it comes from ZhaoZhou.  What interests me is, unless the phrase is found somewhere else, how familiar Yunmen was with ZhaoZhou.\n\nYunmen uses the phrase two or three times, ZhaoZhou only once.""Sometimes it is call the \"triple gate.\"\n\nGoogle translate went insane on the link to the Blue Cliff Record.""Disagree.""If a sincere man expounds the true Dharma, it becomes false.""This is \"can't tell black from white\".""\"Kitchen cupboard, 3 gates\" why isn't this just \"kitchen cupboard\", \"three gates\"?  The kitchen cupboard has a door with food inside.  The monastery has three gates with a lecture inside.\n\nAlso, given the translation in the Joshu and here, isn't it more likely \"nothing is better than a good thing\"?\n\nThe translator is splitting them up, numbering them sequentially, and then includes that strange six character code.""Often... frequently.""If it was easy then everybody would do it.\n""Bankei is an interesting case of a Zen Master becoming enlightened without having learned this \"Buddhist language.\"\n\nHui-neng is likely a similar case.""Following is not drinking.""Mazu approved him, Huangbo seems to have quoted from the text repeatedly.  \n\nTa-hui also pass the Hakamaya test in that he argues for a) freedom rather than altruism; b) non-causality rather than causality; c) transmission outside of words and sentences as opposed to valuing words.\n\nHakamaya's argument about Buddhist texts appears to be based on an attempt to reconcile various inconsistencies in Buddhists texts.  Clearly I don't know enough, but \"quite faulty\" is likely to be a blade that cuts both ways.""While you are following me around pulling on the hem of my robe, I'm reading Yunmen and misattributing Huihai and Huaihai, so would the real skeptic please stand up?\n\nAs it turns out I am a rat, first among the animals.  But instead of getting to know me, shouldn't you be looking into this question of your self nature?  If you are disappointed now, what happens then?\n\nI think this is what songhill (and the others) must have meant about leading people astray.  I'm leading you astray by pretending to answer your questions.  I'm entertaining you when you should be practicing.  That's it isn't it?  I'm right, aren't I?  All the people in the front and the back nod.\n\n""Disagree.""Agreed, now that I compare the texts.  There is no use saying there is no confusion when clearly I'm confused.  \n\nBlofeld's introduction to Ta-chu Hui-hai compares and contrasts *Zen Teaching of Instantaneous Awakening* with Huangbo's text which he also translated.  That's where my confusion started.  But now that I look there is no mention of Huangbo in the text.\n\nIn contrast, when I flip through *Sayings and Doings of Pai-chang\" there is Huangbo again and again messing the place up.\n\nSo, who is Ta-chu?  I am loath to admit it, but I looked in the Ferguson and he isn't in there.  Why?  What are the Japanese and Pin Yin versions of his name?  I'm not saying that I'm surprised that Ferguson left something out... but a whole book?  A whole book which appears to be a written text (bring us to three in total, right?) rather than transcription?  Did he have any students?  What are his dates?\n\nSo I got Sun Face Buddha out and low and behold, there is Ta-chu in the table of contents.  I flip to his chapter, there are my notes in the margin.  Who's running this monkey house?  You should come by more often.\n\nHere is his intro from Sun Face Buddha:\n\n&gt; Ch'an Master Ta-chu was a native of Chien-chou.  His family name was Chu.  He left home and started studying Buddhism under Venerable Tao-chih of Ta-yun Monastery in Yueh-chou.  Later on he went to Kiangsi and became a disciple of Ma-tsu.  He stayed with Mas-tsu for six years, after which he returned to Yueh-chou to take care of his aging teacher.  During that time he composed a treatise entitle: *Discourse on the Essentials of Entering the Way Through Sudden Awakening*.  It was only after Ma-tsu saw the text and approved of it that Ta-chu started to teach.\n\nWait for it.  The story gets funnier.  So I went back to Ferguson (I'm not proud or tired) and I looked up Tao-chih, Ta-chu's first teacher, thinking, you know, right, that Ta-chu might be listed under that lineage.  Ferguson might make that mistake.  Nope.  Not in there.\n\nSo I google Tao-chih.  I end up on [this page](http://www.energyenhancement.org/zen/Osho-Zen-Hyakujo-The-Everest-of-Zen-with-Basho's-Haikus-Chapter-1-The-language-of-suddenness.html) where the story I just told you about Ta-chu, from the book Sun Face Buddha, appears to be exactly reproduced with Hyakujo's name substituted in for Ta-chu's.\n\nBai-zhinga.  \n\nSo on to other matters.  Did you have any suggestions on the question of [texts on Critical Buddhism](http://www.reddit.com/r/zen/comments/1o8v0j/texts_on_critical_buddhism/)?  Other than the cautionary note?  Particularly the texts in response to Critical Buddhism?  A title maybe?\n\n""Generally I just have to dance around and be silly long enough for the \"true believers\" to be honest with me.  Since you only hint that you believe you have attained something, we aren't quite there yet.  Your \"plopping\" is closer to it.\n\nIf you are going to preach your religion, why not do it through the texts that you believe in?  Why not write a book for us?\n\nI am surprised that people try to get me in their cross hairs when there is Mazu, ZhaoZhou and Dongshan.  Since they didn't teach religion why not aim at them?  Hakamaya is an honest man even if he is a religious one.  He knows the difference between Zen and religion, and who to take aim at.  I recommend him.\n\n""You showed me a translation of a quote by an unknown person.  I can't find out much about Ta-hui.  Some of the text is Hui-neng's family, some of it isn't.  Anybody can write anything an slap a name on it.  Generally when I read someone I question their teacher and their students.  \n\nThere is no bible in Zen.  Foyan and Huangbo both suggest meditation.  This doesn't get us to Northern School, this doesn't get us to Dogen.

I don't claim to understand anything, I point people to the text.  That they believe something other than whatever the text says it \"their understanding.\"""It is likely the text you refer to was written by another of Mazu's heirs, Ta-chu Hui-hai.  I've been trying to find out more about him with little success.\n\nI have two different translations of the text... and they are markedly different.  However, neither of them goes particularly well with the Hyakujo fragments that survive or the Huangbo.  So the Ta-chu theory, whatever it is based on, has that going for it.\n\nHere is a little something from the text which is very reminiscent of D.T. Suzuki's work on Hui-neng's dhyana in *The Zen Doctrine of No-Mind*.\n\n&gt; My definition of dhyana just now referred to that perpetual dhyana which is unaffected by speech or silence.  Why?  Since the nature of dhyana functions even while we are engaged in speaking, or in making distinctions, our speech and those distinctions also pertains to dhyana.\n\nBoth the Suzuki and passages like this shine some light on Foyan's three classification of  sitting meditation, reading the ancients, and paying attention as fundamentally the same activity.  \n\nFurther, this all weighs on the role of dialogue in the history of Zen, from Bodhidharma texts to Master Yuan to Hui-neng's interview with the Northern School student to Mazu, the so called King of the Zen Dialogue.  Dialogue is not merely blabbermouthing, but is fundamentally  a result of the activity of dhyana.  Pointing, whether in word or action, as a result of the activity of dhyana.\n\nI encourage you to continue in your studies.""Joshu, Mumon, Baso, Nansen, Tung-Shan, Ummon... all of them could have said, \"Zen is a direct expression\" but they didn't.  They didn't use the word \"Buddhism\".\n\nYou can make up whatever story you like, but it isn't in the text.\n\nFurther, when you make up a story it becomes harder and harder to come to the text and hear it without preconceptions.\n\nIn any case I don't say that Zen and Buddha are particularly apart... only your understanding of Zen is apart from Zen, and your understanding of Buddha is apart from the lineage of Bodhidharma.""You make lots of claims about Buddha.  I offer you what Masters said that does not fit your claims.\n\nYou make lots of claims about your understanding.  I offer you what Masters said that does not fit your claims.\n\nYou claim a special context that Zen Masters didn't teach, a key for a lock they never taught.  I ask, where did they teach this \"special understanding\"?\n\nI acknowledge that you are a Buddhist of some attainment.  Perhaps you attainment believes in some of what Zen Masters taught.\n\n\"Some\" is not Zen.\n\n""These are things you say, not things that Zen Masters say.  \"Buddhism\" is a word invented in the West, not a word that Zen Masters used.  Their context was their family.  Your context is your belief in what you claim being \"fact\".\n\nYou don't need the sutras to understand Joshu.  He said, \"I can't rewrite the sutras without you.\"  ""What Zen Master taught your \"basic semantics\"?\n\nYou wander around insisting that you have seen something when really this is just to avoid looking.\n""\"Make every effort\" is Buddhism, not Zen.\n\nHere is Joshu, who taught something different then \"make every effort\":\n\n&gt; A monk asked, \"If a person comes to you, as I have, do you teach him or not?\"\n&gt; \n&gt; ZhaoZhou said, \"I teach him.\"\n&gt; \n&gt; The monk said, \"If a person does not come to you, do you teach him?\"\n&gt; \n&gt; ZhaoZhou said, \"I teach him.\"\n&gt; \n&gt; The monk said, \"I grant that you teach the one who comes to you, but how do you teach the one who does not come to you?\"\n&gt; \n&gt; ZhaoZhou said, \"Stop!  Stop!  You mustn't talk about it.  'My Dharma is subtle and hard to think about'.\"\n\n""One less.""I notice that you do not say where Mumon (or Joshu) mentions this \"special context\" that is required for understanding their teachings... as I said, such a context is based only on religious faith, not on the text.\n\nYour rhetorical questions are all interesting.  Mumon wrote a book about Zen, perhaps he has some suggestions you might consider.  Or Foyan.  Or Joshu.  Or Tung-Shan.  Or Mazu.  Huangbo says quite a bit about the special transmission.\n\nThe 5th Patriarch is said to have passed the robe and bowl to Hui-neng because of all the 500 students under the 5th Patriarch, Hui-neng was the only one who did not understand the Buddha-Dharma.  What sort of \"special context\" is that?\n\nWhen Tokusan, King of the Diamond Sutra, received the transmission, a candle was blown out.  The next day he burned his notes on the sutras in the public hall.  Perhaps there was a clue to the \"special context\" in those notes?  \n\nWhen Mazu/Baso twisted Baizhang's/Hyakujo's nose, Baizhang went of crying.  The next morning, like a spoiled child, he rolled up his prayer mat and went off before Mazu could start his lecture.  Mazu went to ask him what the matter was and Baizhang said, \"Yesterday you pulled my nose and it hurt.\"  Mazu asked, \"Where had you fixed your mind yesterday?\"  Baizhang replied, \"My nose doesn't hurt today.\"  Where is the \"special context\" in any of that silliness?\n\nYou believe in what you have, thus there is no room in your heart for the special transmission that passed between Ryutan and Tokusan, between Baso and Hyakujo, or between 5P and 6P.\n""Blyth called Ummon the greatest of all Zen Masters!  I call him, \"crazy uncle Yunmen.\"\n\nDogen invented a new Zazen.  Previously there was the sitting meditation that Foyan talks about, the sitting meditation that the Northern School did, and the Quietism sitting meditation that Mumon, Hui-neng, Foyan,  Bankei, and others mocked and rejected.  I might be able to scrape together some characteristics of all of these but I'm not scholar on the subject.\n\nDogen taught a zazen that was \"a oneness-of-practice-and-enlightenment\".  When anybody says \"zazen\" these days it is reasonable to assume they mean Dogen's zazen.  The Critical Buddhists and I agree that Dogen's zazen is Buddhist, not Zen.""Which Zen Masters discussed this \"special context\"?  Specifically, where do Joshu and Mumon teach it, refer to it, or acknowledge it?\n\nIf you can't answer, the this \"special context\" is just faith.

It is not contained in words and sentences.\n\n""Pleasure isn't  a teacher either?\n\nI was just joking you.  Certainly \"everything we do is our study\" is one way to look at it.  \n\nUnderneath this conversation is a significant difference between Zen and Buddhism (did you see that coming?)  Buddhists often preach learning from suffering, from life in general.  Foyan, in stark contrast, says this:\n\n&gt; How about when they say the sound of the rain has given you a sermon?  Is that correct?  I do not agree; the sound of the rain is you giving a sermon.  But do you understand?  Clarify it directly; then what else is there?\n\nBuddhism is looking in the world, searching for wisdom, searching for the method, the manifestation, searching for a solution to their equation(s).\n\nZen Masters don't teach searching for anything or manifesting anything.  They teach sudden awakening in one glance.  How can that be found?  After that what is there to manifest?\n\nP.S.  When we say \"everything we do is our study\" the question of course is what is being studied?  What is ewkbot studying?""\"Yumen struck the monk\" is a common phrase.\n\nPerhaps more reading and less contemplation might resolve this confusion.""As I've said, suffering is not a teacher.""Again, we are talking about different things.  You are talking about something to do with faith, I am talking about drinking tea.  You say \"idiots\" and \"discern\" and \"more important.\"\n\nFor me there are no idiots, nothing to discern\", no \"more important\" and it is just tea drinking.\n\nThose who believe as you do can hand out robes and teach discernment.  The old men I point to asked, \"What do I have to teach you?\" and chased people away.\n\nYou say \"agree.\"  Tung-Shan said, \"I agree with half.\"  Thus you are bound to your side, and Tung-Shan and this family are bound to nothing.""\"Personally offended.\"""It's fuss over freedom and religion.  Some old men said, \"That's not what I'm talking about\" and then later some priests said, \"We will tell you what they were talking about if you sit in these pews and pray.\"\n\nIt almost killed Bankei.\n\nOther than that, I agree.""Really?  What of those who believe they know who is an idiot?""\"You need to\" is how you ended up with \"idiot\" in the first place.\n\nSome are eager to learn, some are eager to teach.\n\nMy business is drinking tea.  If you say that drinking is tea not Zen, this is just back to \"idiot\" again.""Daitsû Chishõ Buddha sat in zazen for ten kalpas and could not attain Buddhahood, why is that?\n\nIdiot!\n\nWhatever I see is my business, there is no study for you in getting any ideas about it either way.\n\n""Agreed.\n\nI disagree with him.  \"Making these distinctions of words isn't work\" is, itself, a conceptual game, played for the purposes of avoiding the work.""\"Bunch of idiots\" is your defilement, and not because they aren't.\n\n""Mazu said, \"This very mind that does not understand is it, there is no other thing.\"\n\n.\n\nMumon said, \"An intimate understanding of the whole line of Zen Masters... see with their eyes, hear with their ears... walk alone through the universe.\"\n\n.\n\nZhaoZhou said, \"I do not enjoy hearing the word 'Buddha'.\"\n\nA monk asked, \"Do you help people or not?\"\n\nZhaoZhou said, \"I help people.\"\n\nthe monk said, \"How do you help people?\"\n\nZhaoZhou said, \"Not aware of the deep principle, futilely laboring to calm the mind.\"\n\nThe monk said, \"You said it was deep, but what is the principle?\"\n\nZhaoZhou said, \"I don't hold on to a basis.\"\n\nThe monk said, \"That is deep, what is the principle?\"\n\nZhaoZhou said, \"The principle is answering you.\"""People use \"Zen\" to mean all sorts of things.  To figure out what sort of books you are looking for you might start by looking briefly at the three links below.  \n\nI suspect that after less than 5 minutes of looking at these links you will be able to decide what you are interested in.  Some people minimize the differences between these three for their own reasons, but a glance should suffice.\n\n1. [Mumonkan](http://www.sacred-texts.com/bud/zen/mumonkan.htm)  This is a text written by a Zen Master for novice monks who are studying Zen.  Mumon writes about the stories (or koans, or Cases) that are often the beginning of the question what does \"Zen\" mean?  Mumon was a Chinese Master, he wrote the book around 1200 CE and discusses the history of Zen starting around 500 CE.\n\n2.  [Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind](http://www.arvindguptatoys.com/arvindgupta/zenmind.pdf)  (Start at page 10)  This is a Soto Buddhist text written by a Soto priest for people who believe in meditation as a sacred practice.  Soto Buddhism is often referred to as \"Zen\" although Soto Buddhism began with a Japanese priest named Dogen around 1200 CE.  Some people believe that Soto Buddhism \"practice\" and Mumon's \"practice\" are the same, compare Mumonkan to Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind and decide for yourself.\n\n3.  [Secular Buddhism](http://secularbuddhism.org.nz/resources/documents/the-sources-of-secular-buddhism/)  This is a short essay that discusses non-traditional Buddhism, Buddhist thinking without the church practices that characterize Asian Buddhism.  \"Western Buddhism\" might be a more accurate way to describe Secular Buddhism.\n\n""From my point of view it doesn't have anything to do with me... like somebody else's favorite flavor of ice cream... why would I be amused by rocky road?\n\nI am surprised at how much time and effort some people around here are willing to put into their objections to me... think of how much Zen study they could be doing instead.\n\n""Look?  Sure.  \n\nLook *for*?  Search?  That's not eyes.  That's the mind creating and attaching.\n\nMy error.  I said \"not to look\" but that was sloppy.  I should have said \"not to search, not to look for.\"\n\n""Why search?  Several of them encourage people not to look.\n\n\"Seek for and attach yourself to nothing\" is how Huangbo put it.\n\nWhether or not you take a walk, whether or not you come across anything, this is just taking a walk, this is just coming across it.""The interesting thing is that some people go their whole lives, every different phase of them, wishing things were other than they are.\n\nSome people wish, with the same desire that you have, to not wish for things to be different.  They have a difficult time too.\n\nWhy believe there is anything to be done about it?""As I said, nobody can do the work for you.""Interesting question.  First, I point you to Elder Ma, someone who studied under Foyan's Master.  Foyan said for years all the Master would ask him was, \"Elder Ma, can you tell black from white yet?\"\n\nIf you can't tell the axe from the bucket, how can you hope to chop wood and carry water?\n\nFinally, all the Masters said, \"not Zen\" about this or that practice, about this or that teaching.  They were relentless in their clarity.  The more you encounter them, how can you help but adopt their attitude?""There aren't two kinds of work.""Foyan suggests several methods at one point, and mind control is one of them.  Why not?  \"Thousand paths, one Way\" they said.  \n\nIt is not so much that sitting is not a path, it is that sitting is not *the* path, it is no more or less than a guttering candle or a woman singing about bean cakes.  Sitting certainly isn't a oneness with enlightenment, it certainly isn't a manifestation of anything sacred.""I don't understand... do you want to trade in your \"me\" for a different set of mistakes and themes?  Or are you saying you prefer having nothing if you can't have what you want?\n\nDo you see?  Some people only drink a particular kind of tea.  They don't like tea, they like what they like.  They don't drink much tea.""If you recognize the preference for insights, then, in terms of the debate, you can either embrace this preference (Buddhism) or discard it, along with everything else you've acquired, as being no better than a bed spread for you when you were sick (Huangbo).\n\nI don't object to your preference, you can choose whatever you like.  But it is not what Huangbo taught.\n""Nobody can do the work for you.""How to discriminate between \"error\" and \"error\"?\n\nMore than ewk!  How proud!  Less than ewk!  How proud!""The light!

If you are here to learn, then why not leave \"doesn't feel quite right\" at the door?

If the ox wanders past your window, this is just an ox wandering past your window.""1/3 Disagree.\n\nRegardless of the author's use of \"your\" and the questions raised by implication, the Zen lineage did not preach an ongoing rodeo.\n\nThis lineage is one that suddenly went home for tea.""Hakamaya is the one with ideas about Original Purity.  Actually all the Critical Buddhists.  That sort of thing has nothing to do with Zen.\n\nI don't have to walk back.  I can say the same thing twice and you can walk back and forth. \n\nI don't know about Buddhism, I haven't met anyone that everyone agrees does.  Hui-neng say know point to knowing about it and I go along with him.  Buddhism is a religion though, ask anybody.  Even the Secular Buddhists are religious about it.  As for Zen, it is not a religion or a philosophy.\n\nIf you read the Hakamaya (remember Hakamaya?  I posted an essay about Hakamaya) you would noticed that Hakamaya argues that all Buddhism is defined by the three part test: a) altruistic; b) causal; c) valuing words as a part of teaching (or something).  While I don't agree or disagree with Hakamaya, why would I?  I'm not a Buddhist, those who would like to make either contrary claims or contest with Hakamaya are welcome to do so.  Apparently there are at least two books on this subject, where Buddhists who don't agree with Hakamaya take a crack at those who do agree with him.  I recently posted the authors and publication dates... I'm not sure if they are yet available in English.  You have provided me time again with interesting links... perhaps you could look into the counter-Hakamaya titles?""If I post an article and then make a comment about what the author says, I don't mean to suggest you take my word for it.\n\nIf you were to, say, hypothetically, read the Hakamaya article, then you could probably make your own statement!  Then I would reread the Hakamaya!""1.  We aren't talking about the same thing.  For example, you say \"original purity is the very basis of Dzogchen\" and what is the basis of Zen?  Not even \"void, nothing holy therein\".\n\n2.  There it is again.  You say that \"declarations of faith\" can be said of Zen, but where?  \"Oak tree in the front garden\" is the totality of what can be said about Zen... what faith?  Even \"declarations\" is just silly.  Thus your \"disingenuous\" is assuming rather than describing.\n\n3. Zen doesn't assert original purity.  Zen Masters negate assertions of both purity and impurity.  You may have gotten confused about this because Hakamaya describes Zen as being in favor of \"original purity\" and contrasts Dogen's position with this view.  However, Hakamaya is in error with regard to Zen.\n\n4.  As for Mumon, I was going to say \"any of his commentaries will do\" but that's probably not fair.  Case 12?  Which one is that again?""Your \"interpreted\" is your interpreted.""So, still not having read Hakamaya, and still not providing me with a specific quote that goes to your claim of \"extraordinary\".  It almost seems you are interested in your own claims rather than it a discussion forum.\n\nIn any case, when Alan Watts said that Zen is not a philosophy or a religion, do you think he meant that all \"Buddhism\" (whatever that is) was also not a philosophy or a religion?  Or is that name dropping, because you haven't read Watts either?\n\nAs for Original Purity, I suppose some Buddhists dig it and some don't.  I can't say for sure what original purity might be exclusive to, because I can't say that \"Buddhism\" is something in particular beyond whatever anyone claims it is.\n\nHakamaya, he says that a) Dogen rejects original purity; b) Dogen's Soto is Buddhist; and c) Zen Masters teach original purity.\n\nHakamaya knows more about Buddhism and Dogen than I ever will.  As far as I'm concerned \"Void, and Nothing Holy Therein\" is not a claim of original purity, it's a recognition that there isn't any purity to have, let alone there being no purity to attain.\n\n\n\n""Is one article too long for you to read?\n\nI don't think \"burden of proof\" means what you think it means.""I don't believe Zen is separate from anything.\n\nI don't try to chop water either.""Whatever you mean by \"transcendence of conditionality\" there is no \"fully understand\" the raising and lowering of the fly swatter.  There are those who say \"fully understand\" and there are those the raise and lower the fly swatter.\n\nThere is no way to confuse the two.\n\n\n\n""First, when somebody gives a logically and taxonomically sound definition of Buddhism, then I compare it to what Zen Masters have said.  So far no definition goes together with the teachings.\n\nSecond, Buddhists who do not give a logically and taxonomically sound definition invariably believe things, any number and variety of things.  Zen Masters didn't believe things, so those sorts of Buddhists are not Zen.\n\nThird, there are Masters who say \"Buddha Dharma\" and D.T. Suzuki seemed to be of the opinion that Zen was Buddhism, so perhaps there is a way to work it out.  Likely if such a solution exists, it will exclude many of those who say \"Buddhism\" these days, and many of the beliefs that Buddhists hold.\n\nHowever it works out is of little interest to me.  I am interested in the lineage of Bodhidharma.  Whatever \"Buddhism\" is in there is all I am concerned with, and no one can say what or even how much there is of that.""Firstly, I haven't even gotten Pruning the Bodhi yet.  So other than the fun of me improv-ing an argument, anything interesting waits on the mail.\n\nSecond, as I've said, I don't know much about Buddhism.  I would expect that, as Hakamaya has done, arguments would be based on particular texts that are in turn based on a some ordering of texts in terms of authority or whatever.\n\nAs far as your quote goes in the context of the Zen lineage, they are not interested in arguments of \"no self.\"  Several of them, when asked about the self, give a variety of answers that stand in sharp contrast against this particular \"no self.\"  Further, the Four Statements of Zen, in that they are a summary of certain conversations and in that there are no Masters who have argued against them, are interested in freedom rather than negation of the self.  \n\nSo, I am unqualified to defend the passage on account of not having read the book yet and not being a Buddhist, and further I am not qualified to defend the passage as it is not Zen. \n\n""You doesn't answer the question, but merely forestall the inevitable debate about exactly what conditioned and unconditioned are, a debate which can only end with you preaching your faith.\n\nThis is why Hakamaya is, regardless of whether we agree with his premises or interpretations of the text, not preaching.  He provides a definition of Buddhism which is not merely based on faith, but on the distinctions of valuation that define that to which faith is applied.\n\nYou could just as easily define \"Christian\" as \"anybody who worships God\".\n\nAs I said elsewhere, the only conversation you can have with the definition you offer is with those who already share your faith, and will accept what you say about conditioned and unconditioned without debate... your definition is the faithful, preaching from the pews.\n\nI don't object to it, I point out that it is not a definition that can be discussed, but only believed.  It also further highlights that what you believe is Buddhism, not Zen.""What are we having?""Let us begin again.\n\nWhat definition of Buddhism differentiates it from those who, for example, subscribe to the perennial philosophy and believe in a unified theory that embraces Buddha and Lao Tzu and Jesus?""Critical Buddhism is a gold mine:\n\n1.  Hakamaya is unusually logical in his approach to problems that surround \"Buddhism\", thus his arguments are explicit and easily discussed.\n\n2.  Critical Buddhism, as a voice from within Soto, has a more textually based view of Dogen and Zen then many others do.\n\n3.  Critical Buddhism wants to compare and contrast the two folios of Dogen, which may also lead to discussion of the multiple authorship of the first Dogen's Shobogenzo.\n\n4.  Critical Buddhism differentiates Zen and Dogen's Buddhism just as I have, but unlike me Critical Buddhism has the attention of scholars and churches that are interested in discussing the texts.  So the counter arguments to Critical Buddhism are potentially text-based counter arguments to comments I've made.  Interesting.\n\nI'm interested in reading what scholars and churches have to say to each other, rather than what scholars say to the public and churches say to their congregations.  Many of the Buddhists I've encountered are just preaching from the pews.""Is that your whole definition?  Anybody who teaches \"transcendence of conditionality\" is Buddhist?""I don't know anything about \"what they say is true.\"""The link is interesting.  Keep them coming!  I took a look at the beginning, and found this:\n\n&gt; Furthermore, as we have seen, the Mahayana and other “superior vehicles” do not conceive the nirvana that is the Third Truth as a mere cessation, for their aim is anuttara \nsamyak sambodhi or “total unsurpassable Awakening,” which involves an active and \neffective wisdom that, besides unveiling the unconditioned and thus putting an end in the \nindividual both to the delusion or error called avidya or marigpa and to the suffering or \nduhkha that issues from it, allows her or him to help all sentient beings to overcome both \navidya and duhkha.\n\nThis provides yet another example of how Zen is not Mahayana, in that both Huangbo and ZhaoZhou set aside \"help all sentient beings\" as that phrase is used here as well as \"or error\" and \"putting an end in the individual\" which Mumon makes several wiseacre remarks about.\n\nAs for the rest of your comments on Buddhism, well, people make declarations of faith all the time.  That sort of thing is not interesting.""Where is your comment on Hakamaya?  Or did you not read it, but went straight to \"burden of proof\"?\n\nPerhaps you could give an example of one of my \"extraordinary claims\"?""You could have read for yourself what Hakamaya says, and you could have respond to his arguments...  I wonder why you didn't?""Hakamaya has put forward a definition of Buddhism, now you put forward yours, and people can make up their own minds about which is more absurd.""ZhaoZhou said, \"I do not like to hear the word 'Buddha'.\"\n\nHe was asked once, do you help people or not?  He answered, \"Buddha!  Buddha!\"\n\nWhatever Zen Masters mean by \"Buddha\", it is not what Buddhists mean.  \n\nBuddhists often don't know what they mean by \"Buddhism\".  When they get that ironed out, only then should they turn to a discussion with these old men about causality, altruism, and words of wisdom.""Your \"Western Zennists\" is the same as your \"speculate\".  If only you would teach yourself!\n\nHere we have \"Zen\" over the door, and as ZhaoZhou said, \"[We] don't like to hear the word 'Buddha'.\"  Thus East is not Zen and West is not Zen.""&gt; The answer is: \"You asking me is [just what] your mind [is]. My answering you is my mind.\n\nThis is what Mazu said.\n\n&gt; Mind itself is buddha4 , and it also thus reverts back.5\n\nMind itself is originally enlightened, thus enlightenment is simply Mind returning to itself.""Typing one handed...\n12+ lines after the passage from yesterday.""It is telling that the word \"buddha\" is so little used in the beginning.  It is also telling that the longer the family was alive, the less they discussed the texts attributed to Buddha.

What else is there?  Bodhidharma was laughing when he said \"Void\" and \"Nothing holy therein.\"  Mazu was bowing when he said, \"This very mind that does not understand is it, there is no other thing.\"\n\nBeliefs have a cost, some sort of sacrifice of passion and intellect.  Every belief is a chain, some kind of bondage.  \n\nKyozan and his family have no such cost.  They are bunch of harmless old men who tell jokes and drink tea and walk freely through the universe.  There is nothing to believe about them.""Why would what you pretend have anything to do with me?""Still more claims?\n\n""More pots and kettles?\n\nI don't know what you mean by \"intellectually dishonest.\"  I would have thought that generally this term applied to people who repeatedly made claims that weren't not based on facts, and that when challenged even then couldn't be bothered to go and find facts.""There is no shortage of my posts... go ahead and find me a \"pot\" and a \"kettle.\"\n\nTake as much time as you like.""Yet we have your \"pot\" and \"kettle\"...\n\nPerhaps you do not always know faith when you see it.""I always yield to knowledge born of faith.

Even if we overlook those, tell me: Which koans are the ones in which the enlightened say they were \"helped\"?\n\nI'm not saying the Zennist is a liar, I only point out that the attainment claimed is not Zen.  Perhaps the Zennist attained the enlightenment preached by Buddha, I wouldn't know.\n\nBut such claims and such attainment have nothing to do with Zen.\n\nAs I have said, Buddhists often confirm their religion in this sentence or that sentence of a Zen Master.  They are eager to do it, to prove themselves, to prove their religion and their attainment.\n\nI am not interested in proving anything to be true.  I point out that these sorts of claims, this belief in \"light\", is the holiness that Bodhidharma began by throwing out.\n\nPerhaps you have found the truth in Linji's teaching as if he was revealing it to you rather than that he was only repeating Huangbo's One Mind, Bankei's Unborn, and Fuke's vegetarian banquet.""You know more than I do.""When we talk about \"what is meant\" we have to ask, when it comes to doctrines, practices and the teachings of Dogen, is all of this \"don't know\"?  So far the Buddhists I've encountered that follow Dogen abandon the \"don't know\" for Zazen and the rest of Dogen's teaching, thus their \"don't know\" is only \"don't know some stuff, but know the heck out of other stuff\".  This is why I say that this gentleman is not teaching the Dharma of No Dharma.""Ah!

Why do they fail to mention this light if your passage is some sort of truth about Zen?\n\nIn the Blood Stream Sermon, Bodhidharma says, \"The truth is there is nothing to find.\"  So, what is this luminosity that the OP claims to have attained?  When you read into Bodhidharma's \"the light is your own true nature\", how do you reassure yourself that you haven't slipped from metaphor into belief in scripture?""You appear to be taking a sentence here and there as scripture.\n\nI take a sentence here and there to show they did not mean any of what is preached in their name.\n\nBesides, you picked \"don't tell others\".

The author values solitude because of the silence of it... but this silence was just a doorway to thought creation.\n\nThere are of course other examples... religious people can say what they found because what they found is their own thought construction, they can believe in it because they created it... this \"luminosity\" is no different from the love of Jesus Christ that some people claim to have found, the language is no different.""Usually around this point in these sorts of conversations I ask:\n\nIs this you preaching what you believe?  \n\nWhen people read your comments, what will people understand about your religion?""All that you are referring to here is what you create.  What you create has nothing to do with your self.  Whatever Huangbo and his relatives meant by \"self\" it is not something created, not something altered, and not something about which anything in particular can be said.\n\nSomeone who believes in Existentialism, who creates it in their mind, might say \"an existentialist choice\" but this is no different than calling something a \"tall choice\" or a \"long choice.\"  There is nothing to it, it is just another illusory thought creation.""The author of that article did not read Huangbo.""Whoever wrote that sutra, what did they mean?  This is one of the problems highlighted by the Critical Buddhism people, Hakamaya among them.  The Buddhist cannon, when reconciled to various orders of eminence, produces a variety of different views that do not reconcile to the views produced other orders of eminence.\n\nIn Zen, there are no such problems of eminence.  Words and sentences do not contain Zen  All this talk is just talk.""The Pure Land guy is preaching Buddhism, not Zen.  Although \"nothing as object\" sounds like Hui-neng and Huangbo, it isn't.  It is not that there is no object to them, it is there is no compassion to attach to that object.\n\nThis happens again and again when Buddhists read particular passages from particular Masters, then Zen looks like Buddhism.  Change Masters, change passages, and the appearance of Buddhism disappears.  This is the error pointed to by the teaching that even a difference of a single hair is the distance between heaven and earth, or something like that.\n\nZhaoZhou said once that he teaches both those that come to him and those that don't.  That is not Buddhism.  He wasn't a lion or a deer, he didn't discriminate between work or play.  He was an old man full of  nonsense trying to sell a stone bridge to people who saw only a plain wooden bridge.""This guy is Buddhist, not Zen.  At the same time, I don't disagree with what he says, just what he means by it.\n\nFor example, he says out of \"not knowing\" comes love and compassion.  If you don't believe you know, then how can you tell the difference between what others value and what you value?  If there is no difference, what distance is there between you and anybody?  If we call this no distance in our hearts \"love\", then we agree.  If we call this no distance in our minds \"compassion\", then we agree.  If we call \"practice\" ordinary mind, then we agree.\n\nOf course if we go on like that sooner or later the Buddhists will object, and go back to sitting rather than talking in this manner.\n\nFor example, this video seems to have begun over politics, perhaps including the question of whether Republicans can be Buddhists.  Generally in America Buddhists are Democrats and Republicans are Christians because in each group their desires accord with the attitudes of those in power in their religions, Buddhists are more interested these days in helping the poor by making them rich, Christians are more interested these days in helping the poor by keeping them poor.  Who is right?  Who is wrong?  The speaker is trying to dodge the question.\n\nThe war in Syria cannot be dodged.  I was on the periphery of some Republicans discussing the war and what was to be done about it.  These particular Republicans were more interested in war than in Christianity.  As such they were accountable to history and logistics more than faith.  They considered the problem from all sides.  They determined first that those who said \"no intervention\" held a flawed position.  Then they determined that those who said, \"intervention\" held a flawed position.  In both cases, they gave historic and logistical reasons for their arguments.  See?  They are Republicans, Christians, and warriors, but they do not know about the war in Syria.\n\nNot knowing is not ignorance or knowledge.  Probably many would agree with those words, but not necessarily what I mean by them.""You are committing a few errors, let us review.\n\n\"Your not Zen\" is just silly.  This \"not Zen\" is theirs, not mine.  Why ask me to explain Hui-neng to you?  Ask Hui-neng.  Ask the other members of this family.  When you do not like their answers, then you know that you prefer Buddhism, not Zen.\n\nYou quote Hui-neng as if you understand what he says because he uses words you have heard other places.  As D.T. Suzuki points out in Zen Doctrine of No Mind, Hui-neng meant something other than what Buddhists mean.  Hui-neng received the robe, the story goes, because he alone did not understand the Buddha Dharma.  How is it that you understand Hui-neng?\n\nFor example, Huangbo says that compassion is not conceiving of sentient beings to be delivered.  In reading Hui-neng, haven't you already failed to do this?  Do you ask Huangbo what Hui-neng meant, or do you ask Buddhists?\n\nFoyan said that vows were for those people who had attachments, that without attachments vows were meaningless.  A person who doesn't steal has no need of a precept against stealing.  So a person who doesn't sin, what need would they have of repenting?  Are vows understood by what Buddhists teach, or what Foyan teaches?\n\nHuangbo said do not take a particular teaching that you think is suitable to a particular moment and regard it as immutable.  Have you taken this Hui-neng as immutable?  Hundreds of years later, a language and a continent away, do you understand Hui-neng better than Huangbo?\n\nPerhaps you would be less inclined to confuse yourself if you worked from Red Pine's translation.  I have noticed that Buddhists who translate Hui-neng in particular discover his hidden Buddhism miraculously, whereas Red Pine doesn't so much.  For example, flipping through Red Pine looking for the passages you have quoted (I didn't find them) I found this:\n\n&gt; Good friends, as for \"I vow to save all beings, no matter how numberless,\" it isn't Hui-neng who does the saving.  Good friends, every being you can think of saves themselves with their own nature in their own bodies.\n\nI acknowledge that, for Buddhists, Hui-neng is a silver tongued devil.  Perhaps those who believe they understand Buddhism should begin with someone other than Hui-neng, like Joshu.  Those who believe they understand Joshu may then begin with Hui-neng.\n""You don't know yet?""What power?  The power of asking questions?\n\nDestroyed how?  By questions? \n\nFrequently I encounter Buddhists, here and elsewhere, who shrug and smile when I ask a few questions.  Other times I encounter Buddhists who become angry that they are not able to answer a few questions.\n\nThis has nothing to do with me of course.  It is tempting to blame others when you don't get what you like, but that you don't like something is something to do with you rather than me, isn't it?""\"Just let it go\" always sounds like Buddhist BS to me.  Like \"sit with it.\"\n\nFoyan has a chapter where he makes fun of unenlightened people who nevertheless claim to be Zen teachers, in one case he says:\n&gt; \"There is another type of Zen teacher who tells people not to make logical assessments, that they lose contact the minute they speak, and should recognize the primordial.  This kind of \"teacher\" has no explanation at all.\"\n\nNo explanation at all... this is what \"just let it go\" is all about.\n\nOut of curiosity, do you recognize the anger of those you interact with even if their anger only rises to the level of irritation?  ""[Below are some quotes from an essay](http://www.thezensite.com/ZenEssays/DogenStudies/Critical_Buddhism_Heine.pdf) on the discussion of Buddhism, Zen, Soto and Dogen's early and later texts.  Let me know if you find any of these books.\n\n&gt; The examination of the 12-fascicle text, so crucial for the Critical Buddhist project, marks what is probably the first time that Dõgen’s thought has been analyzed by specialists in other schools of Buddhism, particularly dhyamika and Yogicara in India and Tibet.  This in turn has elicited an enormously profuse and thoughtful response from traditional Dõgen scholars. **Although Hongaku shisõhihan, the title of HAKAMAYA’S book (1989) that unveiled the new methodology, refers only to a critique of original enlightenment, the second half of the book deals almost exclusively with Dõgen’s rejection of Zen notions such as special transmission outside the scriptures** and unity of the three teachings of Buddhism, Taoism, and Confucianism, and it introduces an attempt to rethink the signifcance of the 12-fascicle text. While his second book (1990) does not deal with Dõgen, his third book (1992b) specializes in issues concerning the composition and compilation of the 12-fascicle text. MATSUMOTO’S book (1989) criticizing tathagatagarbha thought, and ITÕTakatoshi’s book (1992a) criticizing Chinese Buddhism, have also commented on the 12-fascicle text, at least indirectly by citing Hakamaya’s views.\n&gt;\n&gt;Two major collections have been published in response to Critical Buddhism, involving many of the leading Buddhist scholars at Koma-zawa University as well as other Sõtõ authorities, who have engaged in a creative dialogue with the views expressed by Hakamaya and Matsumoto. These collections contain a two-pronged exchange of ideas.\nOne collection (NARA1992) focuses, in an advocacy-response format, on the extensive or “meta” issues of resituating Dõgen, and Zen as a whole, in the context of the overall development of Buddhism, and includes a section on the 12-fascicle text with contributions by Hakamaya, Kawamura, and Itõ Shðken. The other collection (KAGAMI-SHIMAand SUZUKI1991) is an intensive textual study that probes in great detail many diverse and highly specialized aspects of each of the fascicles in the 12-fascicle text in comparison with the 75-fascicle text.  For Critical Buddhism the extensive issues cannot be separated from the intensive issues concerning the Shõbõgenzõ,though the former are\nperhaps better publicized.""I haven't read it!  Excellent.  I'll read it and get back to you.""Mumonkan is a work of some genius.  Mumon edits down all these blabbermouths to a few words.  Of course then he adds his own blabbermouthing, which is the tradition.  More or less it is translated consistently wherever I find it.  A few mistakes here and there can be easily found out by having two or three translations at hand.  Mumon wrote it for novices, he understood his audience.  Katsuki doesn't appear to understand that he is in that audience.\n\nThere are, there have long been, head monks all over the world that are surprised to learn that they don't know what they are talking about.  Tung-Shan had the nickname \"He who questioned the head monk to death\" not accidentally.  If you read Foyan or Mumon they will tell you: you can only go to yourself.  As Huangbo said, anybody who teaches you a method is only teaching you a thought constructed dharma having nothing to do with Zen.\n\nThe Masters are all very clear, there is no tool, there is no means of any sort, there is no \"end'.  They said this over and over and over.  People build temples and pretend to teach all sort of things, this is just what believers do.  I've encountered a few people who, beginning with a deep religious conviction in this \"tool\" or that idea, read into all the texts they come across a deep confirmation of their own comprehension.  When they encounter an oak tree in the front garden they have a marvelous explanation for it.\n\nWhat do Zen Masters teach?  Go ask them.  I don't have a marvelous explanation for it.""Copyright law has crippled the book market for anything written in the last 80 years that isn't a new title.""Buy it from the UK.

As Foyan said, you may want to sit on the long bench quietly for a few minutes first.  As Huangbo said, don't seek for or attach yourself to anything when you drink the tea.  As ZhaoZhou said, a good thing is not as good as nothing, so don't make a ceremony about it, just drink the tea.  As Yunmen said, you have posed the question; now drink the tea.""\"anymore\" implies the \"once spoken of\" doesn't it?  If it hasn't been spoken, then why say \"spoken anymore\"?\n\nI agree with the parallel construction in \"one movement won't be\" and \"How does this movement originate\"... but how are these two constructions carried over in the following thought... \"come forward and express it\"?  Plus we have \"tongue\" and \"the entire Buddhist cannon\" which are both reference to speaking, to what is said.\n\nSo, why not \"Spoken one time, it won't be spoken again.  How is it spoken originally? ...Come forward and try to speak.\"""All this is you talking to yourself.  ""I looked over a few pages of it.  As long as you take Katsuki as a fellow student with no understanding of Zen the translation looks adequate.  \n\nKinhin is  Buddhism, not Zen.  Mumon said that unifying and pacifying the mind is Quietism, and false Zen.  Several Masters reject practices and methods that alter the mind.  Foyan talks about how people misunderstand meditation... it is just a few minutes of sitting quietly on a bench to prepare for the study of Zen.\n\nAt the core of it, kinhin and zazen prefer one state of consciousness over another.  Those that teach such methods believe that there is some distance between people and enlightenment and that this distance can be crossed with some practice or method, or that there is something to manifest.  Zen Masters teach none of that.\n\nWhen you find yourself slipping into a meditative state remember that your training in it, your preference for it, is just another way of pulling the wool over your own eyes.""If you can't define \"Buddhism\" then why makes claims about Zen?\n\nAs I've said elsewhere, of all the definitions I've encountered the most precise is Hakamaya's.  He is a Soto scholar, he argues Dogen's work is Buddhism, not Zen.  He says that Buddhism is threefold: a) causal; b) altruistic; c) values words as a medium for wisdom.  Hakamaya correctly points out that each of these three criteria excludes what Zen Masters taught.\n\nOf course not everyone agrees with him.  Certainly in the West there are many who make claims about Zen and Buddhism.  These claims mostly depend on church doctrines, undisclosed taxonomy failures, and translation errors.""People ask me about sitting all the time.  Rarely does anyone ask me about drinking tea.\n\nZhaoZhou doesn't teach sitting meditation.  Those who teach sitting meditation can't teach ZhaoZhou.\n\nI don't heard oxen.

Did Mazu intend to enlighten anyone through nose twisting?  How can we say Mazu was interested in whether Baizhang would enjoy it?  How can anyone argue that nose twisting is teaching?  How can we say that this single twist of the nose was either helping or hurting?\n\nPeople who believe things and who intend to teach them, invariably they will have the authority to abuse students, no institutional system in the world can weed out moral corruption, Catholic or Buddhist or whatever.

Or do you mean the distinction that is discriminating between what you like and what you don't like that 3P taught?\n\nIt is easy to overlook these old men who asked simple questions like \"where are you going?\" and \"where have you been?\" and gave simple answers like \"No\" and \"Three pounds of flax.\"  It is just as easy to mistake distinction for discrimination or mistake recognizing an error for knowing some truth.""I was contrasting \"deep\" and \"great\" with Zen, which is the school of chop wood and carry water, the school of ordinary.\n\nZhaoZhou (Joshu) was asked for instruction and he gave, \"Did you eat your rice?  Then wash your bowl.\"  This is why I say \"deeper practices\" and no \"great experience\" is not Zen.""I don't claim to have attained anything, I don't claim that there is any method to attainment, I don't claim that there is anything to be obtained.  Those are the claims of people who believe in things.\n\nI leave \"solve\" to those people who claim to \"know anything\".\n\n\n\n""This is a fairy tale, meant to reassure children.""Not Zen.\n\nWhat Master ever taught \"deeper practices\"?

He doesn't begin with Bodhidharma and the lineage, he is making a documentary about his belief in meditation.  While he talks about including more than just his personal beliefs, this \"more\" is a more that he values from within his beliefs.\n\nSo the resulting product will be an affirmation of what he thinks he knows.

It goes like this:  The Chinese put some of the finest teas on a boat and sent it to England as a gift.  During the voyage, the tea got soaked in salt water.  \n\nWhen the tea arrived, the British drank it away.\n\n""Mumonkan.\n\nCase 3 Gutei Raises a Finger                    三　倶胝堅指\n \n倶胝和尚、凡有詰問、唯擧一指。\n\nWhenever Gutei Oshõ was asked about Zen, he simply raised his finger.\n\n後有童子。因外人問、和尚説何法要。\n\nOnce a visitor asked Gutei's boy attendant, \"What does your master teach?\"\n\n童子亦堅指頭。\n\nThe boy too raised his finger.\n\n胝聞遂以刃斷其指。\n\nHearing of this, Gutei cut off the boy's finger with a knife.\n\n童子、負痛號哭而去。\n\nThe boy, screaming with pain, began to run away.\n\n胝復召之。 童子廻首。 胝却　堅起指。\n\nGutei called to him, and when he turned around, Gutei raised his finger.\n\n童子忽然領悟。\n\nThe boy suddenly became enlightened.\n \n胝將順世、謂衆曰、吾得天龍一指頭禪、一生受用不盡。\n\nWhen Gutei was about to pass away, he said to his assembled monks, \"I obtained one-finger Zen from Tenryû and used it all my life but still did not exhaust it.\"\n\n言訖示滅。\n\nWhen he had finished saying this, he entered into eternal Nirvana.""Why would I feel superior?  Some of them have more tea than I do.\n\nIn any case, you have undone what you claim by making my point for me.

Less cheap would be Baso, going up to Hyakujo after Hyakujo rolls up his mat and leaves before the lecture.\n\nWhen you ask \"how can a Master see what a Master sees?\"  I can only answer you, \"What does a Master see?\"""No refunds.""As Gutei said... one finger Zen has never been exhausted.\n""If somebody passed you on the street, you probably could tell if they were a professional Sumo at a glance.  If I asked you if you could tell a professional Lemon at a glance, you would probably would say no, since you've never seen a professional Lemon.\n\nYes, that's what Bankei is talking about.""I was going along with the literary device angle in my own way... the lineage texts are mostly old men poking holes rather than handing people a lifeline, mostly encouraging personal authority discovery rather than offering something discovered.  \n\nThis contrasts sharply with much of the popular modern writing that calls itself Zen, which offers solutions and a view of the world that they are encouraged to share.""I bought a copy from Amazon despite the staggeringly high price.  I'll post a review about it when I can get the time to watch it.\n""No.  All of them seem to have demonstrated this first glance confirmation at one time or another, or spoken of it.  Goso's Case in Mumonkan about greeting a man of the Way on the road is the essence of this first glance business.\n\nI'm pointing out that there is no infallibility to Zen Masters.  They don't claim to be Popes.  They don't win every Dharma combat.  They can make mistakes like anybody else.""Such a test is not for novices... such a test is for those who claim to teach Zen.  In front of all their students, facing a ghostly apparition, their lives hanging in the balance, how many of them would dare to explain a koan they had never heard before?""&gt; Also, Yantou said, \"Those who cultivate purification must let it come forth from their own hearts in each individual situation, covering the entire universe.\"  How can this be quiet sitting and meditating?\n\n.\n&gt; But when you get to a quiet place, you still don't get to the ultimate point.\n\n.\n&gt; This is not a matter of longtime practice; it does not depend on cultivation.\n\n.\n\n&gt; These days quite a few just employ this path of \"right now,\" totally unable to get out of the immediate present.  Nailed down in this way, they try to study Zen without getting the essential point.  \n\nAgain, Foyan, Mumon, Bankei, they are emphatic that what they are talking about is not sitting quietly.  Foyan's suggestion on the similarity of three methods: reading koans, meditation, and active observation are all the same thing... if one practice seems different than the others then there is an error somewhere.  Thus perhaps quietly settle the koans, actively meditate, or studious observe...""Bankei doesn't talk about work... what he says is scream in pain when you are in pain, but don't attach to it afterwards.\n\nPeople who sit invariably settle.  This is the \"danger\" of sitting, that it produces an effect that can be attached to.\n\n\"Naturally and without effort\" itself excludes sitting.  Chop wood, carry water, drink tea, cross the street... whatever happens then is ordinary without effort and without no-effort.\n\nI'm not familiar with \"looking backwards\".  There is a suggestion by Cleary in the Foyan that it might be a meditation method, but there isn't much to go on.""Yes, that's a proof.\n\nWumen (Mumon) and ZhaoZhou (Joshu) both refer to this as recognition as not infallible.  Often in this lineage a Master will ask a question or two.  Some people who are not Masters but have spent years in study approach the appearance of freedom, but that is not freedom.\n\nThere are several Cases that bear on this, Kyozan and Chuyu Koon, Tung-shan and the head monk.  Masters would also continue to prod each other, even those who had met before.""Foyan says it is like recognizing your own father's face when you meet him far from home after years of being apart.  You don't need anyone to tell you who your father is.""You might look at D.T. Suzuki's Zen Doctrine of No-Mind because it is about how Hui-neng used the word dhyana.\n\nWhat dhyana means aside, my point is only that Foyan mentions three different ways to do the \"work\" of studying Zen.  1) Read the stories of the ancients; 2) Sitting meditation; and 3) What he calls \"observing attentively everywhere.\"  At least in terms of Foyan, then, meditation is not observing everywhere attentively.\n\nThis does raise the question how are these three sorts of work some kind of Zen study.  Also the question, how is sitting quietly not the work of meditation that Foyan is explaining.  This is where his \"looking backwards\" starts to become something to investigate.\n\nIn any case what I am rejecting is settling the mind.  While it is good for the nervous system, while it relaxes and refreshes, it comes at a cost.  While it can be used to prepare for work it can also be used to avoid not only work, but the difficulties of life.  \n\nThose people who sit with anger and sorrow and pain and lust are quieting them away.  Other religions have similar methods for escaping.  There is no escaping in Zen.  As Bankei says, if you are in pain then scream in pain.  Afterward, that is when the work is done.""It isn't any work to unify and pacify the mind.  Just sit quietly for a little while.\n\nObserve attentively everywhere is one of three methods Foyan mentioned, and it isn't the sitting meditation method.\n\nYes, I'm saying that still water sitting is error.  Not only did Foyan point this out, saying pointedly that \"waiting\" was not the work he was talking about, but Mumon said, \"Sitting blankly in Zen practice is a condition of a dead man.\"\n\n""That is exactly what \"pacification\" means, settling the waters.  \"Just sit and watch\" is unification and pacification of the mind.\n\nWhy bother with it?  \"Water\" isn't settled or not settled.  It's nature is not found in it's movement or in the absence of movement.  It is, whatever is, a thing that may or may not being moving, that may or may not reflect this or that.""In the cup.""Attentive looks where it's going.\n\nZoning out doesn't.""I suspect that the self disappearing is unification and pacification.\n\nJoshu and Yunmen are very different people.  There is nothing disappeared about them.""Really?  Interesting.\n\nWhat did you mean by \"Yet sitting practice is Zen practice\"?  ""What does tea exist relative to?\n\nI study very carefully, not the tea in my mind.\n""Foyan talks about it at some length.  Like Mumon, he objects to unifying and pacifying the mind which is hat is commonly taught in the West these days.""Ah!  Now you claim you didn't claim what you claimed!  \n\nThis is one of the difficulties in making claims when people can read back through your comments.\n\nOr perhaps you didn't say what you mean?""Disagree.\n\nAll this unconditioned in the Bodhidharma lineage produces a madhouse of nonsense, stone bridges that nobody can cross, gates without entrances and on and on.\n\nThe study of these conditions is trying to look into the eyes of a dragon by studying it's footprints in the snow on a hot day.  What is there to study?\n\nThat was a big one!""\"If you are a peg, endure the knocking.  If you are mallet, strike!\"""We started this conversation with you making a claim.  I ask you about it, but instead you make another claim.  When I ask you about that claim, you make a new one.  Then after awhile you start telling me what I am thinking, and after that what I know, and now you moved on to the claim that I'm crazy.\n\nTell me, what do you claim that the book claims?\n\nThe book was just a bunch of old men talking to no purpose as a demonstration of how those who talk to a purpose are not talking about what the old men were talking about.  \n\n\"Void and nothing holy therein.\"  Sounds like a claim to those who have not heard of the Dharma of No Dharma, to those who have not heard of Zen.\n\nI'm not building anything.  I'm a petty thief.  I steal imaginary hammers.  It's a tradition in this family.\n\n""How do you know that I know?  What is \"knowing better\"?\n\nI'll tell you what I know.  I know that you don't know what you think I'm building with the hammer you imagine I have.\n\nBeyond that I probably don't know.  I'm easily confused and distracted.  For instance I started out talking to you about your claims about Zen and sitting meditation and now I'm talking to you about an imaginary hammer.\n\nBut you brought it back to the beginning for us.  So tell me, what is this \"Buddhism\" that you think you know, and what has nothing to do with it?""What sutra can you get from the sound of a drum?\n\nWhen Hyakujo's nose was twisted, what prism was he looking through?\n\nTalking about it or not talking about it, no rewards and no risks.""First you hand me a hammer, then you call me stupid for not knowing what you are building?\n\nIs this what you have learned of Buddhism so far?""Your hammer, your imagination.\n\n""Again I ask you, what am I building?""He is saying you can study anything... there is nothing that is a prerequisite for anything else.""You said \"hammer\".  Your imagination provided this \"hammer\".  As a demonstration that this is just your imagination at work, I ask you,  What this hammer is doing?""What am I building?""Actualizing it is just echoing them, they are echoing you.\n\n\"Normal person\" is just what you have experienced so far.  Just now I am right in front of you.\n\nHolding onto \"normal person\" is like holding on to \"teacher\".""Some don't.  Some do.  \n\nI've heard of these old men, their family was given the name \"Zen\".\n\nOne of them said, \"To separate what you like from what you don't like is a disease of the mind.\"\n\n""Huangbo's don't separate from ordinary life, don't become entangled in it... Bankei's scream in pain when in pain... how long does pain last?  How long does anger?""\"Gong fu\" is an interesting phrase...\n\n\"Hair holes\" is interesting because information comes in that way.  Head hair fur doesn't have as much information.\n\n\"Fur\" turns up all over the place in these texts.  Nobody ever footnotes it.  When I look it up it says \"hair\".\n\nAnother thing to consider when you embark on a full translation (kickstarter it!) is what the Te Tao Ching translator does.  He says in the footnotes, \"So-and-so has it as XYZ and Whosis has it as LMNO.  I translate this character and that character as ABC\".  This sort of footnote is useful to people who read more than one translation and compare.""That is the same as never teaching.  Are you trying to get on my christmas card list?  Halloween is next.  I give the candy to everyone who comes to the door.""I'm not sure what me not being candid would look like.  \"Professional ewk\" is the same as this ewk, the same as \"hanging out ewk.\"  The topic changes, but not the ewk.\n\n\"Pretentiousness\" is interesting.  Whether rich or poor, people can hold it up.  I've met pretentious poor and pretentious rich.  I've also met just poor, and just rich.  What is the difference?  When they say one is better than the other?  Maybe when they say that what they have is better than what you have?\n\nAs for live and living, I'll buy you lunch if I'm in your neck of the woods and you can ask me anything you like.\n\n""Did I teach you yet?""It's from me.  How can you steal it when I gave it to you?""Why would I?\n\nWhere is there mud?""What you  said reminds me of that views that I found in the article on secular Buddhism... how can the West practice Indian Buddhism?  Only the Indians can do it, just as only the Chinese can practice Chinese Buddhism.  Thus the secular Buddhists are looking for U.S. Buddhism.  That they haven't found it yet is no surprise, they are still making it out of \"U.S.\" and \"Buddhism\".\n\nOf course the U.S. is a melting pot... so it would be interesting to ask the secular Buddhists how much of India and China they are willing to accept in their recipe.\n\n""Can you say that with your teacher mouth?  What can you learn from your teacher when you are pretending all the time?\n\nWhat can you learn from me?  Is it me that shows you how you hide from your own reason?  Is it me that gives you the freedom to run your mouth?  I don't think so, no.\n\nYou have only given yourself permission to say what you like to me, whereas with your teacher you say only what you believe your teacher will like.\n\nThus your teacher is just chains to you, how can you see your self nature in anything there?  ""This is another part of your game.  First the claims, then the hiding from them, then the talk about ewk starts.

When you can talk to your teacher with this mouth and talk to me with the mouth you answer your teacher with... right there look for your Buddha nature.\n""All this flattery!  It is as if you want something from me.""Isn't being attentive to \"lost in thought\" still attentive?  Zoning out is an interesting phenomena... it may be \"not being attentive\".""How can \"attentively\" be \"tends to get lost in 'concept forming' and 'remembering'\"?""&gt; You may contemplate the stories of the ancients, you may sit quietly, or you may watch attentively everywhere; all of these are ways of doing the work.\n\n""Whether you answer or not, you are playing.  I just encourage you see through the game you pretend is mine.""This text is all I've got.  \n\nThe link is stuff I haven't seen yet.  It seems to be suggesting a new definition of baudda... is it \"those who are awakened\"?  Awakening?\n\nThe taxonomy problem with \"Buddhism\" is it assumes a category that doesn't exist... but \"followers of Buddha-Dharma\" doesn't specify which Dharma... just as \"those who are awakened\" doesn't suggest any particular awakening.\n\n""Again though we are back to your imagination.  I can't play this game without you imaging that you know something.  If you didn't imagine you knew something, what could I ask about?  If you didn't make claims based on your imagination, how would you find yourself not answering?\n\nHow can this be my game?  Your rules, your imagination.  I'm just the guest, aren't I?""That is an interesting explication of watching.  I don't think that what you are describing is what Foyan was talking about when he mentions the three methods.\n\n""This is called \"not answering.\"  If you don't know, you don't know.  Why pretend to answer with \"cool\" and \"super neat\"?\n\n""We began with your claim \"sitting practice is Zen practice\".\n\nThis is the same imagination I referred to.""It's a theory.  Remembering a sunset is not watching a sunset.  The experience of watching the sunset requires, again in theory, both a sunset having been watched and a memory of having watched it.""Krish is a tricky guy.  He isn't big on giving anybody something to hold on to, but he wants to study the mind and thus he needs tools to do it... tools that can be held on to.  He's a tricky guy.  I'll take a crack at him if only to inspire the insights of those that disagree.\n\nIn this case, do you remember every minute of every day?  No.  So experience, as it is captured by memory, records only certain things.  So not all things are recognized because not all things are recorded.\n\nThen we have the question of what is remembered.  Things that have happened are remembered, not things that are happening.  So, the recording takes place after the events have transpired.  Where is the newness then?  People who experiment with consciousness are looking for new things to record, but what is recorded is already old, already in memory, rather than in the world.  Thus such experiments are very limited.""Your \"some way it's supposed to go\" is just more of \"don't be hard on yourself\".\n\nWhy imagine there is any such thing as either one?\n\nPeople who are not familiar with this family often talk themselves into corners in the beginning.  Have you met Tung Shan?  He is a member of this family. ""That's sort of like what the Head Monk said to Tung shan.  The rest of the conversation didn't go the way he wanted either.""How, compared to \"cool\" and \"hard on yourself\"?\n\n""\"Hard on yourself\" comes from knowing something.""Not yet.""As I've mentioned before, Amban said the very same thing to Mumon.  Amban said that Mumonkan was like stuffing novices so full of bean cakes that they couldn't swallow anything.  Amban said that \"chatterbox\" was a nickname inherited from Buddha.\n\nPeople all over the world for generations upon generations have been nailed down by blabbermouth Buddha, and he didn't have any more to say than Ummon or Mumon or Amban or even this ridiculous \"ewk\".""Really?
