 The Benefits of Bodhicitta
Unedited Transcript
 Respectfully I prostrate to the Blissfully Gone Buddhas 
   endowed with Dharmakaya 
As well as to their bodhisattva offspring
   and to everyone worthy of prostration 
Let me explain how to engage in the Blissfully Gone offsprings code 
Which I’ve compiled and condensed in accord with Buddhas’ words
 I’ve nothing to say here that’s not come before 
And I lack any skill in the crafting of verse 
Yet though I lack even the thought to help others 
I’ve composed this to familiarize my mind
 For due to acquaintance with what is constructive 
The force of my belief may increase for a moment 
   even just through these words 
And if others equal to myself in fortune happen to see them 
Perhaps they might find them meaningful too
 Having gained this body with respites and enrichments
   so hard to find 
Which can fulfill the wishes of every being 
If in this lifetime I don’t actualize its benefits 
When later will a perfect endowment with one come
 Just as a flash of lightening on a dark cloudy night 
For an instant brightly illuminates all 
So in this world through the might of the Buddhas 
A positive attitude rarely and briefly appears
 Thus constructive behavior is constantly weak 
While negative forces are extremely strong 
   and most unbearable 
Except for a full bodhichitta aim 
Can anything else constructive outshine it
 The Kings of the Sages having thoroughly reflected for many eons 
Have seen this very mind to be of best help 
For by it limitless masses of beings 
Will quickly and easily attain Supreme Bliss
 Those who wish to destroy the hundreds of sufferings
   of compulsive existence 
Those who wish to dispel the sorrow of limited beings 
And those who wish to enjoy the hundreds of states
   of much happiness 
Will never give up the bodhichitta aim
 The moment miserable beings bound in the prison 
Of uncontrollably recurring samsara develop a bodhichitta aim 
They’re called spiritual offspring of the Blissfully Gone
And become figures to be honored by the gods of this world 
   as well as by men
 Like the supreme creation of a gold-making elixir 
This unclean body having been taken will be transformed 
Into the priceless gem of a Triumphant One’s body 
So firmly gain hold of what’s known as bodhichitta
 Since the immeasurable mind of the sole Navigator 
   for wandering beings 
Has seen its precious worth upon examining fully 
Please anyone wishing to be parted from the plights 
   of wandering beings: 
Gain hold truly firmly of this gem bodhichitta
 Everything else that’s constructive resembles the plantain tree: 
Having given birth to its fruit it’s depleted 
But the tree of bodhichitta forever bears fruit 
And never depleted it grows ever more
 Even if they’ve committed extremely unbearable negative acts 
Why don’t the caring rely on that 
Which when relied on will instantly free them 
Like relying on a hero when greatly afraid
 Like the time-ending fires it burns off with certainty 
In an instant enormous negative karmic force 
With wisdom the Guardian Maitreya has explained 
Its fathomless benefits to Sudhana
 Bodhicitta is to be known in brief 
As having two aspects: 
A bodhichitta aim that aspires to enlightenment 
And a bodhichitta that’s engaged with attaining enlightenment
 As is understood by the distinction 
Between aspiring to go and actually going 
So the learned understand the distinction 
Between these two to be as if stages
 Although great fruits arise even in recurring samsara 
From an aspiring bodhichitta aim 
Positive force doesn’t accrue without interruption 
As it does with an engaged bodhichitta aim
 As soon as someone perfectly gains hold 
Of that mind with the thought 
Never to turn back from totally liberating 
Infinite realms of limited beings
 From that time onward 
Whether asleep or even not caring 
A profusion of positive force gushes forth 
Without interruption equal to space
 For the sake of limited beings admiring modest aims 
The Thusly Gone Buddha himself 
Has proclaimed that this is correct 
In The Sutra Subahu Requested
 If having a thought to be of help 
Even thinking May I relieve limited beings 
Merely of headaches 
Comes to have fathomless positive force
 What need to mention the wish to relieve 
Each and every limited being of fathomless miseries 
And the wish to help each and every limited being 
To actualize fathomless good qualities
 Who has such an altruistic mind as this 
Do even fathers Do even mothers 
Do even gods and sages 
Does even Brahma have it
 If those limited beings even in their dreams 
Have never before dreamt of such a mind 
Even for their own sakes 
How would it have arisen for the sakes of others
 This extraordinary jewel of the mind – 
A mind for the sake of limited beings which in others 
Doesn’t arise for even their own sakes – 
Crystallizes as something of unprecedented wonder
 How can the positive force of a jewel-like mind 
Which is the cause of happiness for all wandering beings 
And the elixir for the sufferings of limited beings 
Be something whose measure can be taken
 If merely a thought to be of help is more especially noble 
Than making offerings to the Buddhas 
What need to mention striving for the sake of the happiness 
Of all limited beings without exception
 Although having the mind that wishes to shun suffering 
They rush headlong into suffering itself 
Although wishing for happiness yet out of naivety 
They destroy their own happiness as if it were a foe
 For those who are destitute of happiness 
And who have many sufferings 
It satisfies them with all happiness 
Cuts off all suffering
 And eliminates even their naivety 
Where is there anything comparably constructive as that 
Where is there even such a friend as that 
Where is there even such a force as positive as that
 If some consider as worthy of praise 
Even someone who’s paid back for helping 
What need to mention a bodhisattva 
Who does good without seeking anything in return
 People honor as someone who acts constructively 
Someone who only briefly gives merely a morsel of meager food 
In a demeaning manner to a few wandering beings 
Satiating them for half a day
 What need to mention someone who constantly looks to give 
For an eternity of time 
   the peerless bliss of the Blissfully Gone Buddhas 
To endless numbers of limited beings 
Fulfilling the wishes of all their minds
 The Sage has said that if someone generates negative thoughts 
Toward a philanthropist offspring of the Triumphant like that 
That person will remain in a joyless realm for as many eons 
As the number of negative thoughts that were spent
 However if someone has an extremely clear-minded 
   belief in such persons 
Its fruits will multiply far more than that 
For even in the most acute situations 
   Triumphant’s offspring never will generate anything negative 
Rather their positive actions naturally increase
 I prostrate to the bodies of those in whom 
The sacred state of mind the gem has arisen 
I take safe direction from those sources of bliss 
Who join to bliss even those who harm them    
 Openly Admitting Previous Negative Acts

 To gain hold of that precious mind 
I offer sincerely to you the Thusly Gone Buddhas 
To the stainless Rare Gem of the hallowed Dharma 
And to you the offspring of the Buddhas with oceans of good qualities:
 Whatever flowers and fruits there are 
And whatever manners of medicine there are 
Whatever jewels there are in this world 
And whatever pure pleasing waters there are
 Mountains of precious minerals and likewise 
Forests and secluded delightful places 
Trees adorned and bedecked with blossoms 
And trees whose branches are laden with all sorts of excellent fruit
 And from the realms of divine beings and others fragrances 
Incense wish-granting trees jewel shrubs 
An assortment of wild-growing crops 
And ornamentals as well fit to be offered
 Lakes and pools adorned with lotus 
And with swans possessing a bewitching cry 
Everything that’s without an owner 
To the far reaches of the infinite sphere of space –
 Taking them to mind I offer them fully 
To you the Sages Foremost of Beings 
   together with your spiritual offspring 
Hallowed objects for offerings having great compassion 
Think kindly of me and accept these tokens of mine
 Lacking in positive karmic force I’m extremely impoverished 
And have nothing else that is precious to offer 
Therefore Guardians whose thoughts are for the welfare of others 
Accept them by the power of your concern for my sake
 All my bodies I offer for eternity 
To you the Triumphant and to your spiritual offspring 
Supreme Beings please fully accept me 
Respectfully I shall serve as your attendant
 Completely under your care and thus unafraid 
Of compulsive existence I shall benefit limited beings 
I shall perfectly transcend my previous negative karmic force 
And henceforth never commit further negative acts
 To bathing chambers exquisitely sweet scented 
With crystal floors transparent and polished to a shine 
Having beautiful pillars glowing with gems 
And crowned with canopies radiant with pearls
 I invite you Thusly Gone Buddhas and your spiritual offspring 
And shower your bodies over and again from many jeweled vases 
Filled to the brim with scented water and delightful things 
To the accompaniment of song and music
 I now dry your bodies with incomparable cloths 
Clean and well-anointed with scent 
And then present you hallowed beings 
With most fragrant robes correctly dyed to color
 I adorn with excellent garments fine and smooth 
And with hundreds of the choicest pieces of jewelry this and that 
You the Aryas Samantabhadra Manjushri 
Lokeshvara and all the rest
 With the best colognes whose fragrant vapors 
Rise to all the myriad worlds I anoint the bodies 
Of all you Kings of the Sages who shine with light 
Like sluiced refined and polished gold
 To you the Kings of the Sages foremost objects for offerings 
I present lovely flowers such as mandarava lotus and water lily 
With sweet fragrance each of them loose and also 
Delicately strung together and exquisite in garlands
 I offer you as well masses of clouds from the burning of 
The choicest incense stealing the mind 
   whose fragrant aroma pervades everywhere 
I offer you also a celestial feast 
With a wide array of dishes delicacies and nectars to drink
 I offer you lamps of precious metals as well 
Arranged in rows on lotuses of gold 
On swept ground sprinkled with scented water 
I scatter beautiful flower petals
 And offer to you with a nature of compassion 
Immeasurable palaces enchanting with arias of praise 
Draped with dangling ornaments of pearls and gems 
   beautiful and sparkling 
Beyond fathom becoming an adornment of space
 Eternally I offer to you Kings of the Sages 
Stunning jeweled parasols with golden handles 
Their rims adorned with exquisite types of decoration 
With an elegant shape erect and gorgeous to behold
 And in addition to this may clouds bursting with the music 
Of a symphony of offering instruments 
And beautiful celestial musicians each take their place 
Alleviating the suffering of limited beings
 May they shower without interruption 
A rain of jewels flowers and so forth 
On all you Rare Supreme Gems of the hallowed Dharma 
And on your stupa monuments and Buddha images
 Just as Manjushri and others 
Have made offerings to you the Triumphant 
So do I too make offerings to you my Thusly Gone Guardians 
And to your spiritual offspring
 I offer praises to you Oceans of Good Qualities 
With melodious eulogies and a sea of tongues 
May clouds of harmonies of melodious 
Eulogies to you amass with certainty all around
 I prostrate to all you Buddhas who have graced the three times 
To the Dharma and to you the Highest Assembly 
Bowing down with bodies as numerous 
As all the atoms of the world
 I prostrate to you bases for the bodhichitta aim 
And to your stupa monuments 
I prostrate to you abbots and likewise to you ordaining masters 
And to you supreme upholders of tamed behavior
 Till I reach the heart of a purified state 
I take safe direction from you Buddhas 
Likewise I take safe direction from the Dharma 
And from you the Assembly of bodhisattvas
 With palms pressed together I beseech 
You Buddhas and bodhisattvas 
Residing in every direction 
Possessing great compassion:
 Throughout my beginningless samsaric existence 
In this and other lives 
I’ve unwittingly committed negative acts 
Or caused others to commit them and further
 Oppressed by the confusion of naivety 
I’ve rejoiced in them – whatever I’ve done 
I see them as mistakes and openly admit them 
To you my Guardians from the depths of my heart
 Whatever harmful actions of body speech and mind 
I’ve committed out of disturbing emotion 
Toward you Three Supreme Gems my fathers my mothers 
My spiritual mentors or others
 And whatever extremely unbearable base actions I’ve done – 
I who am full of negative force 
That gives rise to faults through many wrong actions – 
I openly admit all of them to you Spiritual Leaders
 But I may be snatched from my life 
Before cleansing myself of my negative forces of karma 
Just as then I may fall to a horrible rebirth 
   I beseech you for safe direction 
To free myself definitely from that with the swiftest of means
 Whether or not I’ve done purification 
Since this Lord of Death who can’t be trusted never will wait 
Everyone whether sick or not dies all of a sudden 
My life can’t be trusted
 Leaving all behind I’ll depart 
But not having realized this 
I’ve committed all sorts of negative acts 
For the sake of my friends and my foes
 My foes will vanish 
My friends also will vanish 
I too shall vanish 
Likewise all will vanish
 Just like the experiences in a dream 
Anything I enjoy 
Will become an object of memory 
Everything that’s passed I won’t see again
 Even within this brief lifetime itself 
Many friends and foes have passed 
But whatever unbearable fruits there are 
From the negative acts I’ve committed for their sake still lie ahead
 Through not having realized 
That all of a sudden I can die like this 
I’ve committed negative acts of so many sorts 
Out of naivety desire and anger
 Day and night without a stop 
This life is always getting shorter – 
No extension ever comes from the side 
Why should someone like me not die
 While lying in bed 
Even if I’m surrounded by all my relatives and friends 
I alone shall experience 
The feelings of my life being severed
 When seized by the messengers of the Lord of Death 
What help are relatives What help are friends 
Only my positive karmic force will provide me a safe direction then 
But I’ve never relied on just that
 O Guardians Not really caring I didn’t know 
There’d be such terror as this 
And so for the sake of this impermanent life 
I’ve caused so much negative karmic force to build up
 If someone even just being led to where 
His limbs will be lopped off today is so terrified that 
With dry mouth sunken eyes and worse 
He appears transfigured from before
 What need to mention the tremendous torment 
When grabbed by the macabre physical forms 
Of the sinister messengers of the Lord of Death 
And fallen into a fit of great panic
 Who can show me a safe and sound direction 
Out of this monstrous horror 
Staring with terrified bulging eyes 
I’ll search the four quarters for anyone who can show me 
   safe direction out
 And then seeing no one in the four quarters 
   who can give safe direction 
I’ll become filled with total despair from that 
If no one having safe direction is there in that place 
What can I do at that time
 Therefore from this very day I take safe direction 
From you the Triumphant you Guardians of those who wander 
Who strove to become safe directions for wandering beings 
And who can remove all my fears with your stupendous forces
 Likewise I purely take safe direction 
From the Dharma you’ve realized 
Which abolishes the fears of recurring samsara 
And also from you the Assembly of bodhisattvas
 Totally panicked with anguish 
To you Samantabhadra I offer myself 
And of my own accord I make to you 
Manjughosha an offering of my body
 To you as well Guardian Avalokiteshvara 
Who are undeceiving in acting with compassion 
I cry out for help in a wail of torment: 
Pray give safe direction to me who has 
such a negative karmic force
 From Akashagarbha Kshitigarbha 
And all you Guardians with great compassion 
I seek safe direction and from my heart 
Cry out for help
 I take safe direction from you the One with a Vajra: 
Upon your sight all malevolent beings 
Such as the messengers of the Lord of Death 
Flee in panic to the four quarters of the world
 Previously I’ve transgressed your advice 
But seeing now these horribly frightening things 
I take safe direction from you and by this 
May I purge myself quickly of these fearful things
 If even when scared by a common illness 
I have to act in accord with a doctor’s advice 
What need to mention when perpetually afflicted 
By diseases like desire that produce hundreds of injuries
 If just one of these can bring all the people 
Living in this Southern Continent to ruin 
And if no other medicine to cure them 
Is to be found in any direction
 Then the urge not to act in accord with the advice 
Of the Omniscient Physicians concerning that 
Which can remove every painful disease 
Is something to be rebuked as extremely naive
 If I need to be careful 
At a small and ordinary cliff 
What need to mention at the cliff over which I can fall 
For thousands of leagues for a long duration in the joyless realms
 It’s incorrect for me to sit at ease 
Thinking I won’t die just today 
For without a doubt that time will come 
When I shall be no more
 Who can give me a state of no fear 
How can I be freed with certainty from this 
If I shall doubtlessly vanish 
How can I sit with my mind at ease
 What I’ve experienced in the past has disappeared 
And because of my clinging 
To whatever extra I have beyond that 
I’ve been acting contrary to my mentors’ advice
 Having abandoned this lifetime 
And likewise my relatives and friends 
If alone I must wander in an uncertain direction 
What use with all of my friends and foes
 From destructive actions comes nothing but suffering 
How can I be liberated definitely from that 
It’s proper for me to think day and night 
Constantly only about that
 Out of naivety or simply not knowing 
Whatever I’ve done that fits into being 
Either naturally disgraceful 
Or a negative act proscribed by you Buddhas
 I openly admit all of them 
Directly before the eyes of you Guardians 
Prostrating over and again with palms pressed together 
And a mind dreading suffering
 Spiritual Leaders in light of my taking my negative acts 
As having been misdeeds I beseech you: 
Since this was not wholesome 
I shall never do them again
 Gaining Hold of a Bodhicitta Aim
Unedited Transcript
 With pleasure I rejoice in the positive actions 
That relieve the sufferings of the worse rebirth states 
For all limited beings and that place these who suffer 
In better rebirth states
 I rejoice in that build up of positive force 
That became the causes for the arhats’ purified state 
I rejoice in the definite freedom of these embodied beings 
From the miseries of uncontrollable rebirth
 I rejoice in the purified state of the Guardian Buddhas 
And also in the levels of mind of their spiritual offspring 
And with pleasure I rejoice in the ocean of positive force 
From their having developed bodhichitta aims 
To bring every limited being joy 
And in their deeds that have aided limited beings
 With palms pressed together I beseech 
The Buddhas of all directions: 
Please shine Dharma’s lamp for limited beings 
Suffering and groping in darkness
 With palms pressed together I beseech 
The Triumphant who would pass beyond sorrow: 
I beg you remain for countless eons 
So as not to leave in their blindness these wandering beings
 By whatever positive force I’ve built up 
Through all of these that I’ve done like that 
May I remove every suffering 
Of all limited beings
 So long as wandering beings fall sick 
May I serve as the medicine 
The doctors and their nurse 
Until they’ve been cured of their illness
 May I eliminate the pain of hunger and thirst 
With a shower of food and drink 
And in the times of the middle eons of famine 
May I myself change into food and drink
 For limited beings destitute and poor 
May I become a treasure that never runs out 
And remain in their presence 
As a variety of sorts of useful things
 To fulfil the aims of all limited beings 
I give without sense of a loss 
My body and likewise my pleasures 
And all my positive forces of the three times
 Giving everything away brings release with nirvana 
And my mind is aimed for realising nirvana 
As giving away all comes together with death 
It’s best to give now to limited beings
 Having given this body to all those with limited bodies 
To do with as they like 
It’s up to them to do what they want: 
Let them kill it revile it always beat it or whatever
 Let them toy with my body 
Make it into a source of ridicule or a joke 
Having given away this body of mine 
For what should I hold it dear
 Let them do whatever to my body 
So long as it doesn’t cause them harm 
But may anything focused on me 
Never turn out to be meaningless
 If anyone having focused on me 
Develops an angry or negative mind 
May that always turn into a cause 
For fulfilling all of his or her aims
 And may everyone who speaks badly of me 
Or does something else that’s of harm 
Or likewise hurls ridicule at me 
Become someone with the fortune for a purified state
 May I be a guardian for those with no guardian 
A pathfinder for those who are on the road 
And a boat a ship and a bridge 
For those who would cross
 May I be an island for those seeking an island 
A lamp for those desiring a lamp 
A bed for everyone wishing a bed 
And a servant for every embodied being 
   who would want a servant
 May I be a wish-granting gem a vase of excellence 
Mantras of pure awareness magnificent medicine 
Wish-granting trees and cows of plenty 
For embodied beings
 And eternally like earth and so on – 
The great elements – and space 
May I serve in a plenitude of forms as the basis for life 
For fathomless numbers of limited beings
 And till they pass to nirvana 
May I serve as well in all ways 
As the causes for life in the realms 
Of limited beings till the ends of space
 Just as the Blissfully Gone Buddhas of the past 
Have generated a bodhichitta aim 
Then lived by the stages 
Of bodhisattva training
 So too do I generate a bodhichitta aim 
To help those who wander 
And shall train in the stages 
Of bodhisattva training
 Purely gaining hold like this 
Of bodhichitta with this sound state of mind 
Afterwards as well to enhance it further 
Celebrate that mind in this way:
 Now my life’s become fruitful 
For having wonderfully attained a human existence 
Today I’ve awakened my Buddha-nature 
And now have become a Buddha’s spiritual child
 Now in whatever way possible 
I shall undertake actions that accord with its traits 
And never defile this impeccable nature 
That lacks any fault
 Just like a blind man 
Finding a gem in a pile of trash 
Likewise it’s come about by some force 
That within me has developed a bodhichitta aim
 It’s the supreme nectar indeed for defeating 
The Lord of Death of wandering beings 
It’s the inexhaustible treasure as well 
For dispelling the poverty of those who roam
 It is the best medicine too that brings to full rest 
The diseases of those who are passing through 
It’s the tree that shelters all wandering beings 
Roaming and exhausted on the roads of their compulsive lives
 It’s the public bridge for freeing 
All wandering beings from the worse rebirth states 
It’s the risen mind-moon for dispelling the fever 
Of the disturbing emotions of those who roam
 It’s the magnificent sun for clearing away 
The mist of not knowing of wandering beings 
It’s the fresh froth of butter that rises to the top 
From the churning of the milk of the sacred Dharma
 For wandering beings roaming as guests 
on the roads of compulsive existence 
Wishing to enjoy a share of bliss 
This is the best for setting them with bliss 
Satisfying the entirety of beings who’ll come as guests
 Today before the eyes of all sources of direction 
I’ve summoned as guests all wandering beings 
For bliss up to the state of a Blissfully Gone Buddha 
Gods anti-gods and so on take joy 
 Taking Care about Bodhicitta
Unedited Transcript
 As a Triumphant Ones’ offspring 
Having firmly gained hold of bodhichitta like this 
I’ll strive never to transgress its training 
Without ever wavering
 For something undertaken all of a sudden 
Or something I didn’t examine well 
Even if I’ve given a promise about it 
It’s proper to examine “Do it or give it up”
 But how can I ever withdraw 
From what the Buddhas and their spiritual offspring 
Have examined with great discriminating awareness 
And I myself have repeatedly examined as well
 If having promised like this 
I don’t carry it through with my actions 
Then by deceiving every limited being 
What will become of my rebirth states
 If Buddha has said that once someone’s made up his mind 
To give away even some small and trivial thing 
And then doesn’t actually give it away 
He’ll turn into a clutching ghost
 Then if I should deceive all wandering beings 
After having sincerely invited them 
To unsurpassable bliss 
Will I go to a better rebirth state
 And how the karma works for someone 
Who gives up bodhichitta yet attains liberation 
Is beyond all thought: 
Only the Omniscient can understand
 For a bodhisattva however this is the heaviest 
From among all the downfalls 
Because if something should happen like that 
It impairs the welfare of all limited beings
 And should anyone else cause an obstruction 
For even an instant to his positive acts 
There’ll be no end to his worse rebirth states 
From impairing the welfare of limited beings
 For if one’s state of rebirth will worsen 
By destroying the joy of even a single limited being 
What need to mention destroying the bliss 
Of embodied beings as vast as all space
 Therefore someone with the force from a downfall 
And the force from developing bodhichitta again 
Keeps bouncing down and up in samsara 
For a long time obstructed in reaching any arya level of realized mind
 Therefore with highest regard I shall carry it through 
Just as I’ve promised because 
If from now on I don’t make an effort 
I’ll wander from lower to ever-lower states
 Countless Buddhas who have helped 
All limited beings have already passed 
Yet I wasn’t an object of their healing 
Because of my mistakes
 And if I still were to act like this 
It would be the same over and again: 
Worse rebirth states sickness death 
Being dismembered and torn apart
 If the advent of a Thusly Gone Buddha 
And gaining embodiment as a human with belief in what’s fact 
And the properly constructive instincts are so rare 
When shall I attain them again like this
 Although on a day like today I’m not sick 
Have food and haven’t any injuries 
Life is but for a moment and will let me down: 
The body is like something on loan for an instant
 And with my behavior like this 
I won’t even attain a human body again 
And if I haven’t attained another human body 
I’ll have only my negative karmic force and nothing constructive
 If even when having the chance for constructive behavior 
I do nothing constructive then what course will I have 
When completely struck dumb by the sufferings 
In the worse rebirth states
 If while not doing anything constructive 
I continue to build up negative karmic force 
Then for hundreds of millions of eons 
I won’t even hear the words “better rebirth state”
 Because of just this the Vanquishing Master has said 
Rebirth as a human is so difficult to attain 
Just as it is for a turtle to stick its neck through the hole 
In a yoke adrift on the vast sea
 If by the negative force of committing a heinous act for an instant 
I must spend an eon in a joyless realm of unrelenting pain 
What need to mention not going to one of the better rebirth states 
Because of the negative force I’ve built up over beginningless samsara
 But just having experienced only that much 
I shall still not get free 
For while experiencing like this 
I’ll prolifically create further negative force
 So if having found a respite such as this 
I don’t make being constructive a habit 
There’s nothing more self-deceptive than this 
There’s nothing more stupid than this
 If having understood this 
I procrastinate stupidly still in the future 
Then when the hour for my dying will come 
Enormous anguish will swell
 Then if my body will burn for so long 
In the unbearable fires of a joyless realm 
There can be no doubt that my mind will be tortured 
By the searing flames of unendurable regret
 Having found somehow a beneficial 
Rebirth so hard to find 
If now while able to discriminate 
I drag myself down once more to a joyless realm
 It amounts to not having had a mind while here 
Like having been stupefied by a mantra spell 
If I don’t know what’s causing me to be so stupid 
Well what is it there inside my head
 Although enemies such as anger and craving 
Have neither legs nor arms 
Are neither brave nor wise 
How is it that they’ve made me like their slave
 For while squatting in my mind 
At their pleasure they gleefully cause me harm 
To be patient and not become angry with them 
Is an inappropriate pathetic place for patience
 Even if all the gods and anti-gods 
Were to rise up against me as enemies 
They couldn’t drag and feed me into the fires 
Of a joyless realm of unrelenting pain
 But those strong mighty enemies my disturbing emotions 
Can in a moment hurl me into them which 
When met will cause not even the ashes 
Of the King of Mountains to remain
 My disturbing emotions are long-standing enemies 
Without a beginning or an end 
No other enemy can be like that 
For such a long time
 With all the others becoming close and serving them nicely 
Bring benefit and happiness 
But being close with my disturbing emotions 
Only harms me with even more pain
 These longtime continuing enemies like this 
Are the sole causes for masses of harm to multiply wildly 
How can I be joyful and not terrified in samsara 
If I set a secure place for them in my heart
 Where can I have happiness 
If in a web of attachments within my mind 
They lurk as guards of my samsara-prison 
Becoming my murderers and butchers in joyless realms and the like
a Therefore I shall never give up my efforts in this 
Until directly myself I definitely smash these enemies
b Having become enraged at someone 
   who caused them even some minor occasional harm 
Those with full-blown pride won’t sleep 
   till they’ve smashed that enemy
 And if while lined up in the height of battle 
   against those with disturbing emotions 
Who will come to suffer their natural deaths anyway 
Those obsessed with vindictively smashing them will dismiss the pain 
   of being struck by the weapons of arrows or spears 
And till accomplishing their aims 
   will never run off in the opposite direction
 Is there need to mention that I mustn’t lose 
   heart and procrastinate 
Even if I’m caused hundreds of sufferings 
When now I strive to definitely overcome my natural enemies 
   my disturbing emotions 
Which are the continual source of all my sufferings
 If wounds without even some purpose inflicted by enemies 
Are held up like ornaments on the body 
Then why are sufferings troublesome to me 
Who impeccably strive to fulfill the Great Purpose
 If fishermen outcastes peasants and the like 
Even with the thought of merely their livelihoods 
Endure such sufferings as heat and cold 
Why aren’t the likes of me patient for the sake of the happiness 
   of wandering beings
 When I promised to liberate from their disturbing emotions 
Wandering beings in the ten directions 
As far as the ends of space 
I myself was not freed yet from disturbing emotions
 And didn’t even realize the extent of my 
   being under their control 
Wasn’t it crazy to have spoken like that 
But as this is so I shall never withdraw 
From destroying my disturbing emotions
 To do this shall be my obsession: 
Holding a grudge I shall meet them in battle 
Disturbing emotions in forms such as these 
Are exclusively for destroying the disturbing emotions
 Better for me to be burned to death 
Or have my head chopped off: 
I shall never in any circumstances 
Bow to the enemy my disturbing emotions
 Common enemies when driven off from a country 
Will settle and occupy other lands 
And when they’ve recovered their strength return once again 
But the way of the enemy my disturbing emotions 
   is not similar in this regard
 Pitiful disturbing emotions when gotten rid of by wisdom’s eye 
And kicked out of my mind where will you go 
Where will you live to come back to harm me 
Weak-minded it’s fallen to my making no effort
 If disturbing emotions don’t live in sensory objects 
   in networks of sensory cells in between the two 
Or somewhere other than that then where can they live to harass 
    all wandering beings again 
They’re like an illusion and because of that 
   I shall get rid of the fear in my heart 
   and devote myself resolutely to striving for wisdom 
Why have I been torturing myself for no real reason 
   in joyless realms and the like
 Having decisively thought like this 
I shall strive to actualize the training just as explained 
Not listening to the doctor’s instructions 
How can a patient in need of a cure be healed by his medicines
 Safeguarding with Alertness
Unedited Transcript
 With the wish to safeguard my training 
I need to work hard and safeguard my mind 
If Im unable to safeguard my mind 
Ill also be unable to safeguard my training
 Left to run loose the elephant of my mind can ravage me 
With a joyless realm of unrelenting pain 
Untamed rutting elephants in this world 
Cant cause me such harm
 But if the elephant of my mind is firmly bound 
By the rope of mindfulness on every side 
All fears will vanish and everything constructive 
Will come into my hands
 Tigers lions elephants bears 
Snakes and all enemies 
The beings who are the guards in the joyless realms 
Witches and likewise cannibals -
 Theyll all be bound by having bound 
This mind alone 
Theyll all be tamed by having tamed 
This mind alone
 The Speaker of the Perfect himself has shown 
That in this way all fears 
As well as immeasurable sufferings 
Come from the mind
 Who intentionally created 
All the weapons for the beings in the joyless realms 
Who created the burning iron ground 
Where did all the siren-maids come from
 The Sage has said that all such things as that 
Are what come from a mind having negative karmic force 
Therefore in the threefold world 
Theres nothing to fear except the mind
 After all if the perfection of giving were 
That the poverty of wandering beings was all gone 
Then how could the Guardians of old have perfected it 
Since wandering beings have hunger still now
 The perfection of giving is said to be 
Through the mind that would give away to everyone 
All that is mine together with its results 
Thus its the mind itself
 Fish and the like where could anyone take them all 
So that they wont be killed ever again 
The perfection of ethical discipline its explained 
Is from gaining the mind to give up such acts
 Cruel beings are everywhere just as is space: 
It cant possibly come that Ill have destroyed them all 
But if Ive destroyed this mind of anger alone 
Its the same as my having destroyed all those foes
 Where could I possibly find the leather 
To cover with leather the whole surface of the earth 
But with leather just on the soles of my shoes 
Its the same as having covered the entire earths surface
 Likewise although its impossible for me 
To ward off external events 
If I would ward off my mind 
What need to ward off anything else
 The result of feeble mental application 
Even when accompanied by speech and physical acts 
Is not like the result of developing an intense mind alone 
Which would be Brahma states and beyond
 The Knower of Reality has said 
That recitation and all physically difficult practices 
Even if done for a very long time will be meaningless 
If done with a mind thats distracted elsewhere
 And those who dont know the secret of the mind 
The paramount significance of Dharma 
Will wander about pointlessly and miserably 
Wishing to gain happiness and overcome suffering
 This being so Ill take hold of my mind 
And safeguard it well 
If Ive left out the taming behavior of safeguarding the mind 
What use are the many other taming behaviors
 Just as Id take great pains and be careful about a wound 
When standing in the midst of an unstable wild crowd 
So too I shall safeguard always the wound of my mind 
Since Im living in the midst of difficult people
 And if Id be careful about a wound 
Even from fearing the wounds hurting a little 
Then why dont I safeguard the wound of my mind 
From fear of being smashed by the crushing mountains 
   of a joyless realm
 If I can remain like this in my behavior 
Then whether Im situated amidst difficult people 
Or placed even in the midst of nubile young women 
My stable restraint shall not fall apart
 Better that my wealth the respect I receive 
My body and livelihood disappear 
Better even that my other virtues decline 
But I shall never let my mind degenerate
 O you who would wish to safeguard your minds 
With palms pressed together I tell you 
Safeguard your mindfulness and alertness 
With all effort
 People who are disturbed by sickness 
Are powerless over all their actions 
Those whose minds are disturbed by bewilderment 
Are likewise powerless over all their actions
 Whatever has been heard pondered and meditated upon 
By those whose minds are lacking alertness 
Will not be retained in their memories 
Just like water in a leaking vase
 Many learned people 
Even when having conviction and extraordinary effort 
Become fouled with a downfall 
Due to the mistake of lacking alertness
 The thieves that come in from their lack of alertness 
Go on after plundering their mindfulness 
To take as well the positive karmic force theyve built up 
So that they go to a worse rebirth state as if robbed by thieves
 This pack of thieves the disturbing emotions 
Searches for a chance to break in 
And having found the chance steals whats constructive 
Destroying the life of a better rebirth state
 Therefore I shall never let mindfulness 
Be taken away from the gateway of my mind 
Should it be gone Ill recall the sufferings 
Of the worse rebirth states and closely reset it
 Through the instructions of the learned and dread 
Gained from living together with spiritual mentors 
Fortunate people who would show them respect 
Will easily develop their mindfulness
 The Buddhas and bodhisattvas are endowed 
With unobstructed vision everywhere: 
Im always standing 
Before the eyes of them all
 Someone thinking like that would take on in this way 
Moral self-dignity respect and dread 
Through this his close mindfulness of the Buddhas 
Would rise up over and again
 When mindfulness is set at the gateway of the mind 
For the purpose of safeguarding 
Then alertness will come 
And even whats gone will come back again
 Whenever Ive recognized that at the start 
The way my minds motivated has some fault 
I shall remain at those times like a block of wood 
Able to restrain myself
 I shall never look around 
Without any purpose because of distraction 
With a resolute mind 
I shall always look with my eyes cast downwards
 But for the sake of relaxing my gaze 
Ill look around now and then 
And if someone appears in my field of vision 
I shall look up and say Welcome
 To check for dangers on the road and the like 
I shall look over and again in the four directions 
Then after pausing I shall turn round and look 
To see whats behind
 Then having examined both ahead and behind 
I shall either go on or come back 
Thus shall I act in all situations 
After knowing whats needed
 Having paused and decided Ill keep my body like this 
And then jumping back into whatever Im doing 
Then later I shall look periodically 
At the way in which my bodys remaining
 With the utmost effort I shall check 
That the rutting elephant of my mind 
Has not been let loose from how its been tied 
To the great pillar of my Dharma intent
 Never letting go for even an instant 
The duty of my absorbed concentration 
I shall check one by one like that each moment of mind 
To see Whats my mind engaging in
 But if Im unable when involved in a frightening situation 
An offering feast or the like Ill let it do whats appropriate 
Thus its been taught that at times of giving 
One may stay with equanimity toward ethical discipline
 Having considered and begun to do something 
I wont think about anything other than this 
Then with my intentions directed at that 
I shall accomplish that very thing first
 Everything this way will get accomplished well 
Otherwise neither will come about 
Also like this the derivative disturbing factor 
Inalertness will never increase
 When various kinds of senseless talk 
And numerous varieties of wondrous entertainment 
Are happening all around 
I shall rid myself of attraction to them
 If for no reason I start digging up the earth 
Picking at the grass or doodling in the dirt 
I shall immediately stop out of dread 
By recalling the advice of the Blissfully Gone Buddhas
 Whenever I might wish to move my body 
Or might wish to speak 
First Ill examine my mind and then act with firmness 
Yoked to whats ethically correct
 When I notice that my mind would compromise 
   with attachment 
Or would oppose this with anger 
I shall not make a move I shall not speak a word 
I shall remain like a block of wood
 If my mind is overexcited and sarcastic 
Or has arrogance and conceit 
Has the intention to ridicule 
Or is greedy hypocritical and deceitful
 When it would readily brag about me 
Or would criticize others 
And become insulting and quarrelsome 
I shall remain at those times like a block of wood
 When my mind would desire material gain
   displays of respect and fame 
Or desire the care of attendants and followers 
Or would wish to be served 
I shall remain at those times like a block of wood
 When my mind would toss away the aims of others 
And wishing to care for my own aims alone 
Would wish to say something 
I shall remain at those times like a block of wood
 When my mind is impatient lazy and cowardly 
Or likewise overly confident and noisy with nonsense 
Or is stubbornly attached to whats on my side 
I shall remain at those times like a block of wood
 Having examined my mind in this way 
For fully disturbing emotions and pointless endeavors 
Being courageous I shall hold it firmly 
With opponent forces at those times
 Resolute and happily convinced 
Stable respectful and polite 
Having moral self-dignity as well as dread 
Quieted down and striving to bring happiness to others
 Never disheartened by the inconsistent whims 
   of infantile people 
And realizing that they arise in their minds 
Because of their developing disturbing emotions 
Having a feeling of kindness toward them
 And influenced by thoughts of myself and these limited beings 
Engaging in things that are never disgraceful 
I shall always keep hold of this mind 
Without self-pride like a magic emanation
 By thinking over and again that its after a long time 
That Ive gained a respite supreme 
I shall hold my mind in that way 
As utterly immovable as the King of Mountains
 If O mind youre not made unhappy 
When this body is completely torn apart and dragged here and there 
By vultures greedy for flesh 
Why are you pampering it now
 Holding onto this body as mine 
Why O mind do you safeguard it so 
Since you and it are two separate things 
What can it do for you by itself
 Bewildered mind why dont you take possession 
Of a clean wooden sculpture instead 
Whats the point of safeguarding this putrid device 
Assembled from unclean things
 First with your intellect 
Peel off and separate the layer of skin 
And then with the scalpel of discriminating awareness 
Slice off to the side the meat from the skeletal frame
 And having split open even the bones 
Look inside down to the marrow 
And examine for yourself 
What essence is there
 If even searching with effort like this 
Youre unable to see any essence in it 
Then why are you safeguarding this body still 
With such attachment
 If being unclean its unfit to be eaten by you 
And even the blood is not fit to be drunk 
And even the intestines not fit to be sucked 
What use is the body to you
 Just secondarily safeguarding it is proper 
For the sake of feed for the jackals and vultures 
This body of human beings is no more 
Than something to be put to good use
 And if even when youve safeguarded like that 
The merciless Lord of Death will still steal it 
And give it to the birds and the dogs 
What will there be that you can do then
 If you wouldnt give clothing and the like 
Even to a servant whos unwilling to stay on and work 
Then why exhaustingly take care of the flesh 
When this body goes elsewhere even having spoon-fed it
 But having given it wages 
Now you must make it serve your own aims 
Dont give it everything it wants 
Without its being of help
 Apply to the body the notion of a boat 
For its merely the support of going and coming 
And transform it into a body that will go as you will 
To fulfill the wishes of limited beings
 Thus I shall have self-control 
And always present a smiling face 
Ill stop frowning and grimacing in disapproval 
Ill be friendly with wandering beings and be honest
 I wont throw down seats and the like 
Recklessly with noise 
I wont pound violently for doors to be opened 
Rather I shall always delight in being quiet
 Storks cats and robbers 
Accomplish their desired aims 
By moving noiselessly and keeping low 
A disciplined bodhisattva always acts in that way
 Respectfully I shall take to the crown of my head 
The words of those skilled in encouraging others 
And who offer their help without being asked 
I shall always become the student of everyone
 I shall say Well spoken to all 
Who speak good advice 
And having seen someone acting constructively 
With praises Ill let it bring me joy
 I shall speak of others good qualities when theyre out of sight 
And when their good qualities are spoken of agree 
When my own good qualities are mentioned 
I shall think of those qualities with appreciation
 All constructive undertakings are a cause for joy 
Which is rare even if money could buy it 
Therefore let me take pleasure with joy 
In the good qualities that others have worked on
 Rejoicing wont bring me any loss in this life 
And in future lives my happiness will be great 
Finding fault will bring me unfriendliness and suffering 
And in future lives my suffering will be great
 When talking I shall speak from my heart coherently 
With the meaning clear pleasingly 
Rid of greed and aggression 
Gently and just enough
 When my eyes behold limited beings 
I shall think Depending on them 
I shall attain Buddhahood 
And look with a sincere and loving manner
 Being continuous driven by a strong intention 
Or driven by an opponent force 
And directed toward those with good qualities the helpful 
   or the suffering 
My constructive actions will become mighty
 Skillful and filled with exuberance 
I shall always do my deeds myself 
I shall never rely on anyone else 
To do any of my deeds
 I shall practice the far-reaching attitudes of giving and so on 
As being more exalted one after the other 
I shall never discard a greater for the sake of a smaller: 
I shall consider most importantly the benefit for others
 Having realized its like that 
I shall always keep striving for the benefit of others 
The Far-Seeing Compassionate One has permitted 
For such a bodhisattva whats prohibited for others
 I shall share with those fallen to ruin those without guardians 
And those maintaining tamed behavior 
And merely eat a proper amount 
With the exception of my threefold robes I shall give away all
 For some trivial aim I shall not harm my body 
Thats practicing the sacred Dharma 
Acting like that all the hopes of limited beings 
Will be quickly fulfilled
 I shall not give this body away 
While my thought of compassion is still not pure 
I shall give it over till then in this and other lives 
   in whatever way possible 
To causes thatll fulfill the Great Purpose
 I shall not explain Dharma to those lacking respect 
To those with heads bound with cloth while not being sick 
To those holding parasols canes or weapons 
Or to those whose faces are veiled
 Nor the vast and profound to those who are modest 
Nor to women without also a man 
I shall always pay equal respect 
To the modest and the supreme Dharma teachings
 I shall not join to the Dharma for the modest 
Those who are vessels for the vast Dharma teachings 
Nor shall I cause them to abandon bodhisattva behavior 
Or entice them into merely reciting the sutras or mantras
 Should I spit or toss away the stick for cleaning my teeth 
I shall cover it over with earth 
Further its despicable to urinate and so forth 
Into water or on land thats to be used
 I shall not eat with stuffing my mouth 
With noise or with my mouth wide open 
Nor shall I sit with my legs outstretched 
Or with my arms simultaneously crossed 
   pressed against my body
 I shall not go in a vehicle on a bed a seat 
Or in a room alone with someone elses woman 
Having observed or inquired I shall give up 
All that would bring disrespect from the world
 I shall never point with my left hand or one finger 
But respectfully with my right 
And with the entire hand 
I shall also indicate the path like that
 I shall not wildly wave my arms 
Nor shout out loud when its scarcely urgent 
But shall signal with a snap of the fingers and the like 
Otherwise Ill get out of control
 Just as the Guardian Buddha lay down to pass to nirvana 
So shall I lie down to sleep on the preferable side 
And with alertness yoke myself firmly from the start 
To the intention to rise again quickly
 Out of all the boundless bodhisattva behaviors 
That have been spoken of 
I shall definitely put them to practice at least to the extent 
Of the conduct for cleansing my mind
 And I shall recite The Three Heaps Sutra 
Three times each day and each night 
And thus with the support of the Triumphant and my bodhichitta aim 
I shall neutralize my remaining downfalls
 Whatever situation I may be acting in 
Of my own accord or from the influence of others 
I shall vigorously train in whatever is the training 
Thats been taught for that situation
 There isnt anything in which the spiritual offspring 
Of the Triumphant dont train 
For those skilled in living in this way nothing they do 
Will escape becoming a positive force
 Whether directly or indirectly I shall not do anything 
Other than whats for the benefit of limited beings 
And for solely limited beings sake
I shall dedicate it all to enlightenment
 
 I shall never forsake even at the cost of my life 
A spiritual mentor who is skilled 
In the points of the Vast Vehicle Mahayana 
And superlative in keeping the bodhisattva taming behavior
 I shall learn the way to respectfully relate to a spiritual mentor 
From Shri Sambhavas Biography 
This and other advice of the Buddha 
Can be known from reading the sutras
 It is in the sutras that the trainings appear 
And so I shall read the sutra texts 
I shall examine as a start 
The Akashagarbha Sutra
 I shall definitely examine 
The Compendium of Trainings over and again 
Because in it what always is practiced 
Is extensively shown
 Or look to the extent theyre condensed in brief 
At The Compendium of Sutras 
And then energetically examine as well 
The second such texts compiled by Arya Nagarjuna
 I shall put into practice 
Whatever is not prohibited in them 
And implement fully the trainings seen there 
In order to safeguard my worldly mind
 The defining feature of safeguarding with alertness 
Is but this in brief: 
Examining over and again 
The condition of my body and mind
 With my body I shall put this all into practice 
What can be accomplished by mouthing it merely with words 
After all will a sick man be helped 
By merely reciting the medical treatment
 Showing Patience
Unedited Transcript
 Whatever generosity 
Offerings to the Blissfully Gone Buddhas and the like 
And positive deeds Ive amassed over thousands of eons - 
One moment of hatred will devastate them all
 As no negative force resembles anger 
And no trial resembles patience 
I shall therefore meditate on patience 
With effort and in various ways
 When the thorn of anger lodges in my heart 
My mind doesnt feel any peace 
Doesnt gain any joy or pleasure 
Doesnt fall asleep and becomes unstable
 Even those on whom he lavishes wealth and honor 
And those whove become dependent on him 
Get provoked to the point of murdering 
A lord whos possessed with anger
 Friends and relations get disgusted with him 
And though he might gather others with gifts 
   he isnt regarded with trust and respect 
In brief theres no way at all in which 
A raging person is in a happy situation
 Hence the enemy rage 
Creates sufferings such as those and the like 
While whoever clamps down and destroys his rage 
Will be happy in this life and others
 Finding its fuel in the foul state of mind 
That arises from its bringing about things I dont want 
And its preventing what I wish 
Anger once enflamed destroys me
 Therefore I shall totally eradicate 
The fuel of that enemy 
For this enemy hasnt a mission 
Other than injuring me
 No matter what happens 
I shall never let it disturb my good mood 
For if Ive fallen into a foul mood what I want 
   will not come about 
And my constructive behavior will fall apart
 If it can be remedied 
Why get into a foul mood over something 
And if it cant be remedied 
What help is it to get into a foul mood over it
 For myself and my friends 
Suffering contempt verbal abuse 
And disgrace arent things that Id wish for 
But for my enemies its the reverse
 The causes for happiness rarely occur 
While the causes for sufferings are overly abundant 
But without any suffering 
   there wouldnt be the determination to be free 
Therefore mind you must think to be firm
 If devotees of Durga and people of Karnata 
Pointlessly endure the torments of burning 
And cutting themselves and the like 
Then why am I such a coward for the sake of liberation
 There isnt anything that doesnt become easier 
Once youve become accustomed to it 
And so by growing accustomed to minor pains 
Greater pains will definitely become bearable
 Dont you see this with problems borne 
   without a great purpose 
From snakes and mosquitoes 
Discomforts such as hunger and thirst 
As well as rashes and the like
 So I shall not be soft 
Regarding such things as heat and cold rain and wind 
Also sickness captivity beatings and the like 
For if Ive acted like that the injury is worse
 There are some who seeing their own blood 
Develop exceptional courage and resolve 
And there are some who seeing the blood of others 
Collapse and faint
 That comes from their states of mind being 
Either of a resolute or a cowardly type 
Therefore I must be dismissive of pains 
And must not be thrown off by suffering
 Even when hes in agony someone skilled 
Will never let the composure of his mind be stirred 
And in a war thats waged against disturbing emotions 
Bruises abound when fighting the battle
 Those who having been dismissive of suffering 
Destroy the enemies anger and so on 
They are the heroes who have gained the victory 
The rest merely slay corpses
 Furthermore there are advantages to suffering: 
With agony arrogance disappears 
Compassion grows for those in recurring samsara 
Negative conduct is shunned and joy is taken in being constructive
 As I dont get enraged 
With great sources of suffering for instance with bile 
Then why get enraged with those having limited minds 
All of them as well are provoked by conditions
 For example without being wished for 
Their sicknesses arise 
And likewise without being wished for 
Their disturbing emotions also strongly arise
 Without thinking I shall get enraged 
People just become enraged 
And without thinking I shall arise 
Likewise rage arises
 All mistakes that there are 
And the various sorts of negative behavior - 
All arise from the force of conditions: 
There arent any under their own power
 A collection of conditions 
Doesnt have the intention I shall create 
And what its created didnt have the intention 
Im to be created
 The darling the Samkhyas call primal matter 
And what they imagine to be the self - 
They dont think with some purpose I shall come into being 
   to cause some harm 
And then come about
 In fact as they havent arisen they do not exist 
So what would have then had the wish to arise 
And since a static sentient self would be something that was 
   permanently occupied with an object 
It would never come to cease being so
 But if the self were static and nonsentient like Nyaya asserts 
It would obviously be without actions like the sky 
So even if it met with other conditions 
What activity could something unchangeable have
 If even at the time of the action it remains as before 
What could have been done by it from the action 
And if there were something called This is its action 
Which is the one that made them connected
 Thus everythings under the power of others 
And the powers theyre under arent under their own power 
Having understood this I shall not become angry 
With any phenomenon – theyre like magic emanations
 And if I said then Warding off anger would indeed be unfitting 
For who or what can ward off what 
Id assert that its not unfitting 
Since by depending on that the continuity of suffering 
   can be cut
 Thus when seeing an enemy or even a friend 
Acting improperly Ill remain relaxed 
Having reflected that its arising 
From some such condition as this
 If all embodied beings had things 
Turn out as they liked 
Then since no one wishes ever to suffer 
It would never come about that anyone suffered
 People hurt even themselves 
With such things as thorns because of not caring 
And in a rage because of desiring to obtain women
   and the like
With such acts as refusing food
 
 There are some who destroy themselves 
By hanging themselves jumping off cliffs 
Eating poison and unhealthy foods 
And through negative acts bringing worse rebirth states
 When people kill even their beloved selves 
From coming under the power of disturbing emotions 
How can it be that they wouldnt cause injury 
To the bodies of others
 When I cant even develop compassion once in a while 
For those like that who with disturbing emotions arisen 
Would proceed to such things as killing themselves 
At least I wont get enraged with them
 Even if acting violently toward others 
Were the functional nature of infantile people 
Still itd be as unfitting to get enraged with them 
As it would be for begrudging fire for its functional nature 
   of burning
 And even if this fault were fleeting instead 
And limited beings were lovely by nature 
Well still it would be as unfitting to get enraged 
As it would be for begrudging the sky for the pungent smoke
   that was rising in it
 Having set aside the actual cause of my pain 
   a staff or the like 
If I become enraged with the person who wielded it 
Well he in fact was incited by anger so hes secondary too 
It would be more fitting to get enraged with his anger
 Previously I must have inflicted 
Such pain on limited beings 
Therefore its fitting that harm comes to me 
Whove been a cause of violence toward limited ones
 Both his weapon and my body 
Are the causes of my suffering 
Since he drew out a weapon and I a body 
Toward which should I get enraged
 Blinded by craving Ive grabbed hold of a painful boil 
Thats shaped like a human and cant bear to be touched 
And so when its bruised 
Toward what should I get enraged
 Childish me I dont wish to suffer 
And yet Im obsessed with the cause of my suffering 
Since its my own fault that I get hurt 
Why have a grudge toward anyone else
 Its like for example the guards of the joyless realms 
And the forest of razor-sharp leaves: 
This suffering too is produced by my impulsive karmic behavior 
So toward what should I be enraged
 Incited by my own karmic behavior 
Those who hurt me come my way 
And if by their actions these limited beings should fall 
   to the joyless realms 
Surely wasnt it I who have ruined them
 Based on them my negative karmic force 
Is greatly cleansed because of my patience 
But based on me they fall 
To the joyless realms with long-lasting pain
 Since Im in fact causing harm to them 
And theyre the ones who are benefiting me 
Why unreasonable mind do you make it the reverse 
And get into a rage
 If I have the advantage of wishing to be patient 
I wont be going to a joyless realm 
But although Im safeguarding myself in this way 
What happens to them in this matter
 And if I were to harm them back instead 
They wouldnt be safeguarded either 
While my other bodhisattva behavior would also decline 
And consequently those having trials would be lost
 Because of its being immaterial 
No one can destroy my mind by any means 
But because of its obsessive involvement with my body 
Its hurt by suffering in connection to the body
 Yet Insults cruel language 
And defaming words 
Dont hurt my body 
So why O mind do you become so enraged
 Others dislike for me - 
That wont devour me 
Either in this life or in any other lifetime 
So why do I find it undesirable
 If I dont wish for it 
Because it would hinder my material gain 
Well although my material gain in this life will have to be discarded 
My negative karmic forces will remain secured
 Death today would in fact be better for me 
Than long life through an improper livelihood 
For even having lived a long time there will still 
Be the suffering of death for someone like me
 Someone who wakes up after having experienced 
A hundred years of happiness in a dream 
And another who wakes up after having experienced 
Just a moment of happiness:
 Once theyve awakened that happiness 
Doesnt return after all to either of the two 
Similarly it comes down to exactly the same 
For someone whos lived for long and someone whos lived 
   for a short while
 Though I may have obtained great material gain 
And even have enjoyed many pleasures for long 
I shall still go forth empty-handed and naked 
Like having been robbed by a thief
 Suppose I said While living off my material gain 
Id consume my negative karmic force and do positive things 
Well if for the sake of material gain I became enraged 
Wont my positive karmic force be consumed 
   and negative karmic force come about
 If the very purpose for which I am living 
Should fall apart 
What use is there with a life 
Committing only negative deeds
 Well suppose I said Rage for someone who maligns me 
Is because it makes limited beings lose their trust 
Well then why dont you get similarly enraged 
With someone defaming someone else
 If you can tolerate distrust when its for someone else 
Because that lack of trust hinges on another
Then why not be patient with someone who maligns me 
Since that hinges on disturbing emotions arising
 Even toward those who revile and destroy 
Images stupas and the sacred Dharma 
My angers improper 
Since there can be no harm to Buddhas and the rest
 And toward those who injure my spiritual teachers 
My relatives and so on and my friends as well 
My rage will be averted by having seen that 
This arises from conditions as in the manner before
 Since injury is inflicted on embodied beings 
By both those with a mind and things having no mind 
Why single out and begrudge only those with a mind 
Therefore be patient with harm
 Some commit misdeeds because of naivety 
And because of naivety some get enraged: 
Which of them can we say is without fault 
And which of them would be at fault
 Why did you previously commit those impulsive actions 
Because of which others now cause me harm 
Since everything hinges on karmic behavior 
Why do I bear a grudge against this one
 Seeing its like that Ill put effort 
Into positive things in whatever way 
Whereby everyone will become 
Loving-minded toward each other
 For example when fire in a burning house 
Is advancing to another home 
Its fitting to remove and throw out 
Whatever its in that would cause it to spread 
   such as straw and the like
 Likewise when the fire of anger is spreading 
Due to my mind being attached to something 
I shall throw it out at that instant 
For fear of my positive force being burned
 Why would a man about to be put to death 
Be unfortunate if by having his hand chopped off he were spared 
So why would I be unfortunate if through human sufferings 
I were spared joyless realms
 If Im unable to bear 
Even this minor suffering of the present 
Then why dont I ward off the rage 
That would be the cause of hellish pain
 On account of my impassioned rage Ive experienced 
   burning and the like 
For thousands of times in the joyless realms 
But through it I havent brought benefit to myself 
Or benefit for others
 But since great benefits will be brought about 
In this which is not even a fraction of that damage 
Only delight is appropriate here 
In the suffering dispelling all damage to wandering beings
 If others obtain the pleasure of joy 
From praising someone I dislike who possesses good qualities 
Why O mind dont you make yourself joyous like this 
By praising him too
 That pleasure of joy of yours would be 
An arising of pleasure that was not disgraceful 
Something permitted by the Ones with Good Qualities 
And superlative as well for gathering others
 If you wouldnt like this pleasure of his 
Such pleasure as that would be only his 
Then from stopping as well giving wages and the like 
Your ruin will come both seen and unseen
 When your own good qualities are being extolled 
You wish others as well to take pleasure 
But when others good qualities are being extolled 
You dont wish yourself to take pleasure too
 Having developed a bodhichitta aim 
Through wishing for happiness for all limited beings 
Then why do you become angry instead 
At the happiness that limited beings have found by themselves
 Having given your word that you wish limited beings 
To have Buddhahood honored throughout the three realms 
Then why when seeing them merely shown miserable respect 
Do you burn up inside at it
 If there were someone needing care 
Whos to be cared for by you and provided for by you 
And that family member were to get something to live on 
Wouldnt you be delighted or would you be enraged in return
 How could someone who doesnt want even that 
   for wandering beings 
Be anyone who wishes for them to be Buddhas 
Where is there bodhichitta in someone 
Who becomes enraged at others gain
 If whether he receives it from him 
Or it remains in the benefactors house 
It will in no way be yours 
So what does it matter whether or not its given to him
 Throw away your positive force or others faith in you 
And even your own good qualities For what 
Dont hold on to what could bring you gain 
Tell me with whom dont you get enraged
 Not only do you not feel sorry 
About the negative things youve done yourself 
You wish to compete against others 
Whove enacted positive deeds
 Even if your enemy lacks any joy 
Whats there in that for you to take delight 
The mere wish in your mind 
Wont become the cause for any harm to him
 And even if his suffering came about through your wish 
Still whats there in that for you to take delight 
If you said that youd become gratified 
Is there anything else more degenerate than that
 This hook cast by the fishermen the disturbing emotions 
Is horrendously sharp Procuring you from them O mind 
The joyless realm guards will cook me for sure 
In the cauldrons of hell
 Praise and fame these shows of respect 
Wont bring positive force wont bring a long life 
Wont bring bodily strength nor freedom from sickness 
They wont bring physical pleasure either
 If I were aware of whats in my self-interest 
What in my self-interest would there be in them 
If just mental happiness were what I wanted 
I should devote myself to gambling and so on and to alcohol too
 For the sake of fame people would give away wealth 
Or would get themselves killed 
But what use is there with words of fame 
Once theyve died to whom will they bring pleasure
 At the collapse of his sand castle 
A child wails in despair 
Similarly at the loss of praise and fame 
My mind shows the face of a child
 Because an impromptu word is something lacking a mind 
Its impossible that it has the intention to praise me 
But proclaiming The other one offering me praise 
   is delighted with me 
If I consider that a cause also to be delighted
 Well whether its toward someone else or toward me 
What use to me is another persons joy 
That pleasure of joy is his alone 
I wont get even a share of it
 If I take pleasure in his pleasure with me 
I must do like that in all cases in fact 
How is it that I dont take pleasure 
When he has the pleasure of joy with another
 So joy is arising in me 
Simply due to Me Im being praised 
But there in fact because thinking like that is just nonsense 
It comes down to nothing but the behavior of a child
 Being praised and such things cause me distraction 
They cause my disgust with samsara to disintegrate as well 
I become jealous of those with good qualities 
And that makes me demolish success
 Therefore arent those who are hovering close by 
For striking down praise and the like for me 
Actually involved in protecting me from falling 
Into a worse rebirth state
 For me whose primary interest is in gaining freedom 
Bondage to material gain and shows of respect are things I mustnt have 
So how can I get enraged with those who are causing me 
To be freed from my having been bound
 For me who would enter into a house of suffering 
How can I get enraged with those whove come 
As if from Buddhas inspiration 
In the nature of a door panel not letting me pass in
 But this one is impeding my positive practices 
Still its unfitting to be enraged with him 
There isnt any trial thats equal to patience 
So shouldnt I be staying just close to that
 If in fact its through my own fault 
That Im not acting patiently here 
Then while a cause for positive practice is biding nearby 
Its actually me whos causing the impediment here
 If there were something that wouldnt come about 
   if something were absent 
But if something were present would also be present 
That very thing would be the cause of that 
So how can it be said that its an impediment to it
 Theres no impediment to giving caused by a mendicant monk 
Gone out for alms at the proper time 
And it cant be said that the coming of someone conferring vows 
Is an impediment for becoming a monastic
 Alms-seekers are plentiful in this life 
But scarce are those who cause me harm 
Because no one will cause me harm 
If I havent harmed them like this in past lives
 Therefore I shall be delighted with an enemy 
Whos popped up like a treasure in my house 
Without having had to be acquired with fatigue 
Since he becomes my aide for bodhisattva behavior
 Its because of its having been actualized 
   through this one and me having met
That a fruit of patience comes about 
So let me award it first to him 
For he was like this the earlier cause of my patience
 Suppose I said But he had no intention for me 
   to actualize patience 
So this enemy isnt someone to be honored 
Well how is it that the hallowed Dharma is honored 
As suited to be a cause for actualizing it
 Suppose I said But this enemys intention was to cause me harm 
So he cant be honored 
Well how could patience be actualized by me 
If like a doctor he were intent on my benefit
 Therefore since patience arises dependently 
From his vicious intention 
This one himself is fit to be honored like the hallowed Dharma 
Because hes a cause of my patience
 Thus the Sage has spoken of the field of limited beings 
As well as the field of the Triumphant 
For having made them happy many have gone thereby 
To the far-shore of excellence
 When the acquisition of a Buddhas Dharma attainments 
Is equally due to both limited beings and the Triumphant 
What kind of order is it that the respect shown to limited beings 
Is not like that to the Triumphant
 The preeminence of an intention is not from itself 
But due to its result and by that the preeminence 
Of that which is had by limited beings is in fact the same 
And because of that they are equal
 Whatever is honored in having a loving intention toward them 
That in fact is the greatness coming from limited beings 
And whatever positive force there is in confident belief in the Buddhas 
That in fact is the greatness from the Buddhas
 Its the share they have 
   in actualizing a Buddhas Dharma attainments 
And because of that theyre asserted as their equals 
But of course no one can be the equal of the Buddhas 
In endless oceans of excellent qualities
 If even a speck of the excellent qualities 
Of the unique syntheses of the best excellent qualities 
Were to be seen somewhere an offering of the three planes of existence 
Would be inadequate for honoring it
 Since a share giving rise to a Buddhas 
Foremost Dharma attainments exists in limited beings 
Its fitting that limited beings be honored 
In accordance with this very share
 Further besides making limited beings happy 
What other repayment is there 
For those who befriend them without pretension 
And help them beyond any measure
 Since it would repay them to benefit those for whose sake 
They sacrifice their bodies and plunge into joyless realms 
   of unrelenting pain 
Then even if these limited beings should cause great harm 
Everything wholesome is to be done for them
 For the sake of even in this case my master himself 
They disregard even their own bodies 
So how can I bewildered about this act with pride 
And not act in the nature of a servant
 The Sages delight in their happiness 
And enter into distress at their injury 
And so in my bringing them joy 
   the Sages will all have become delighted 
And in bringing them harm the Sages will have been hurt
 Just as there could be no mental pleasure from desirable objects 
For someone whose body were completely on fire 
Likewise theres no way to delight the Greatly Compassionate Ones 
When limited beings have in fact been harmed
 Therefore whatever displeasure Ive brought 
   to all the Greatly Compassionate Ones 
By my having caused harm to limited beings 
I openly admit today that negative deed 
And request the Sages please bear with that displeasure you have
 From now on for the sake of delighting 
   the Thusly Gone Buddhas 
I shall act with definite restraint as a servant to the world 
Let mobs of people kick me in the head with their feet or 
   even beat me to death I shall not venture anything back 
Let the Guardians of the World take delight
 Theres no doubt that Those with a Compassion Self-Nature 
Have taken all wandering beings to be the same as themselves 
The very nature theyve seen as the essential nature of limited beings 
Is those Guardians self-nature 
   so why dont I show them the same respect
 Just this is what brings pleasure to the Thusly Gone Buddhas 
Just this is what perfectly accomplishes my own aims as well 
Just this is what dispels the worlds suffering too 
Therefore let it be just this that I always shall do
 For example even when some member 
   of the royal court 
Is harming the public 
Farsighted people do not hurt him back 
Even if theyre able
 For that one acting like this is not alone: 
On the contrary the kings power and might are his military forces 
Likewise some lowly person creating harm 
Is not to be belittled
 For his armed forces are the guards of the joyless realms 
And all the Compassionate Ones 
So like a commoner toward a violent king 
I shall make all limited beings be pleased
 Should even such a king be enraged with me 
Could he inflict the pain of a joyless realm 
Which is what Id be brought to experience 
By having made limited beings displeased
 Should even such a king be pleased with me 
Its impossible that he could bestow Buddhahood 
Which is what Id be brought to attain 
By having made limited beings be pleased
 Leave aside seeing that the future attainment of Buddhahood 
Arises from making limited beings be pleased 
Dont you see that at least in this life great prosperity 
Fame and happiness come
 Moreover with beauty and so on 
   freedom from sickness and fame 
Someone with patience while still in samsara 
Gains extremely long life and the abundant pleasures 
Of a universal chakra king
 Joyful Perseverance
Unedited Transcript
 Patient like that I need to embrace joyful perseverance 
Since based on perseverance enlightenment takes place 
After all without joyful perseverance theres no arising of positive force 
Just as without wind theres no motion
 Whats joyful perseverance 
Its zestful vigor for being constructive 
Its opposing factors are explained as lethargy 
   clinging to whats negative or petty 
And from being discouraged disparaging oneself
 Lethargy arises 
From apathy about the problems of recurring samsara 
Which comes through relishing a taste of pleasure from idleness 
And through craving sleep as a haven 

 Sniffed out by the trapper the disturbing emotions 
And fallen into the trap of rebirth 
How do you still not realize 
That youve landed in the mouth of the lord of death
 Dont you even see that hes slaughtering 
The members of your herd each in turn 
Yet despite being like a buffalo at the butcher 
You even go to sleep
 With the road blocked everywhere 
And eyeballed by the lord of death 
How can eating bring you joy 
How can sleeping How can making love
 So stock up on a bountiful store of positive force while you can 
For death will come all too soon 
Even by throwing off lethargy then 
What can you accomplish when out of time
 With this still not done this just having been started 
This still left half-done 
And the lord of death having come all of a sudden 
And the thought arising Oh no Im destroyed
 And seeing relatives 
Their faces with red eyes swollen from the force of grief 
And flowing with tears having lost all hope 
And also the faces of the messengers of Yama
 Tormented by the memory of negative acts 
Hearing the screams from the joyless realms 
Body befouled with excrement because of fear - 
Having become delirious what will you do
 If like a live fish flopping about to be cooked 
Youd have such terror in this lifetime 
Is there need to mention the unbearable tortures 
Of the joyless realms when having created so much negative force
 Baby-skin 
Even at the touch of hot water youre scalded 
How can you sit back at ease like this 
Doing karmic deeds for a joyless realm rebirth
 Dreamer of results without any effort 
Weakling Waster of plenitude 
Seized by death and having the airs of an immortal god 
Oh dear With these miserable ways youre destroying yourself
 Seated in a boat now of a human rebirth 
Cross over the mighty river of suffering 
With this boat being so hard to catch again 
Idiot its not time for going to sleep
 Letting go of the joy of the hallowed Dharma - 
The best an unending fount of joy - 
How can you find any joy in such causes for suffering 
As shenanigans joking and the like
 So dont get discouraged amass the supporting forces 
Readily accept and take control of yourself 
Then equalize self and others 
And exchange self for others too
 Never get discouraged by thinking 
How can there be enlightenment for me 
For the Speaker of Truth the Thusly Gone Buddha 
Has pronounced this truth like this:
 Even those whove become gnats mosquitoes 
Hornets and worms likewise too 
Shall attain unsurpassable enlightenment so hard to attain 
By generating the force of zestful vigor
 How much more so for someone like me 
   having Buddha nature and born as a human 
Able to perceive whats of benefit or harm 
Why shouldnt I reach enlightenment 
So long as I dont quit bodhisattva behavior
 Suppose I said But it frightens me 
That my arms legs and so on are to be given away 
Well Im being reduced to fear by a state of bewilderment 
From failing to discern whats heavy or light
 For countless millions of eons 
Ill be gashed stabbed burned and split open 
Innumerable times 
And still wont attain enlightenment
 But this suffering Ill have 
In achieving enlightenment is something with a limit 
Like the pain from an incision made on my body 
To remove the harm from a foreign object festering inside
 All doctors in fact bring freedom from sickness 
Through the discomforts of medical treatments 
So a little discomfort must be endured 
To kill off a plague of sufferings
 Yet the Foremost Physician hasnt offered 
The usual healing treatments like these 
But rather cures countless chronic afflictions 
With an extremely gentle procedure
 As a start the Spiritual Guide prescribes 
Giving away a vegetable and the like 
Once accustomed to that one may eventually 
   through stages 
Come to give away even ones own flesh
 When the insight arises that my very own body 
Is similar to a vegetable and the like 
Then as for giving away such things as my flesh 
What hardship would there be in that
 After all from purging negative karmic force
   therell be no more suffering 
And from becoming mentally proficient
   there wont be any more mental distress 
But similarly from distorted conceptions the mind gets hurt 
And from negative force the body
 Through positive force though the body has joy 
And with mental proficiency the mind becomes joyful 
So even remaining in recurring samsara for the sake of others 
What could depress a compassionate one
 Because the strength of his bodhichitta aim 
Is depleting his negative forces from the past 
And gathering oceans of positive force 
Hes explained as surpassing the shravaka listeners
 So mounting the horse of the bodhichitta aim 
Which dispels all depression and exhaustion 
And journeying from joy to joy 
Who with a sensible mind would ever become discouraged
 Thus the supporting forces for fulfilling the aims of limited beings 
Are strong intention steadfastness delight and letting go 
Strong intention is developed from the dread of suffering 
And by reflecting on its benefits
 Uprooting opposing factors like that 
I shall strive then to further my zestful vigor 
With the forces of strong intention having pride 
   delight and letting go 
Also readily accepting and taking control
 But the faults of both myself and others 
That Ill need to vanquish are boundless 
And when the depletion of each individual fault 
Will take oceans of eons
 And even a fraction of that initiative 
For depleting those faults cant be seen yet in me 
Then how is it that my heart doesnt burst 
At the fathomless sufferings that Ill need to endure
 The excellent features for both myself and others 
That Ill need to actualize are also enormous 
And there when the repeated practice for each individual feature 
Will take oceans of eons
 And Ive never developed the repeated practice 
For even a fraction of the excellent features 
Its amazing how Ive rendered meaningless 
This rebirth somehow attained
 Ive not made offerings to the Vanquishing Master 
Nor provided the joy of magnificent feasts 
Ive done no services for the teachings 
Nor fulfilled the hopes of the poor
 Ive given no freedom from fear to the frightened 
Nor offered comfort to those in distress 
It comes down to all that I have produced 
Is only discomfort and the pain of an alien object
   in the womb for my mother
 Since such a poor mess has come about 
Through my lacking a strong intention for the Dharma 
In former lives and now 
Who would ever give up strong intention for the Dharma
 The Sage has chimed A strong intention is the root 
Of every constructive facet 
And the root of that is constantly having meditated on 
The ripened results of karma:
 Pain foul moods and assorted forms of fear 
And being parted from what I would like 
Come about from behaving 
With negative karmic force
 Consider this: by enacting the constructive deeds 
That my mind has intended 
Wherever Im reborn Ill be honored 
   through their positive force 
With an oblation as the karmic result 

 But by enacting negative deeds 
Though I wish for happiness 
Wherever Im reborn Ill be assaulted 
   through their negative karmic force 
By weapons of pain
 By constructive behavior 
   Ill come to stay in the presence of the Triumphant 
   as a spiritual child of the Blissfully Gone 
With a superb body born from a lotus opened 
   by the splendor of the Sage 
And dwelling in the heart of a spacious fragrant cool lotus 
My radiance shall grow with nourishment from the Triumphants melodious voice
 But by serial destructive behavior Ill fall onto a fiercely flaming 
   iron ground 
Horribly tortured by Yamas henchmen ripping off my entire skin 
Pouring into my body molten copper liquified by enormous heat 
Stabbing me with flaming swords and daggers and rending my flesh 
   into hundreds of bits
 Hence I shall set a strong intention 
   to do whats constructive 
And make it a habit with regard 
Undertaking it then Ill make it a habit of having pride 
Through the lines in the Vajradhvaja Sutra
 Examining my talents first 
To undertake something or not undertake it 
Its better not to undertake it at all - 
Not to start it and then turn back
 For that turns into a habit in future lives too 
And causes negative force and suffering to increase 
While other undertakings and the time for their results 
Are weakened and do not succeed
 Actions disturbing emotions and abilities - 
Pride is to be applied regarding the three 
Its something that I myself shall do 
Is having pride regarding actions
 Worldly beings not under their own power 
Due to disturbing emotions are unable to accomplish 
   their very own aims 
But Im not incapable like wandering beings 
So Ill do this for them
 How can I stand by 
While someone else is doing an inferior job 
If its because of being proud that Im not doing it instead 
Then best to let pride be exterminated in me
 Even a crow makes itself act like an eagle 
When encountering a snake thats already dead 
But if I remain timid 
Even the slightest setback impairs me
 Discouraged and having given up effort 
Will there be liberation due to feeling bankrupt or what 
But by strengthening my effort through having my pride 
Even huge things will have difficulty triumphing over me
 Therefore with my mind steadfast 
I shall set back setbacks 
For if setbacks bankrupt me 
My wishing to triumph over the three realms 
   becomes a joke
 I shall triumph over everything 
And nothing shall triumph over me 
As a spiritual offspring of the Triumphant Lion 
I shall maintain this pride
 Wandering beings conquered by pride 
Are disturbed: they have no pride 
For those having pride dont fall under the enemys power 
But instead have power over the enemy pride
 Filled up with the disturbing emotion of pride 
Theyre led by pride to the worse rebirth states 
And even as humans their festivity is killed 
They become slaves eating the scraps of others
 Stupid ugly feeble 
And insulted in all situations
If filled up with pride those having trials 
Are also included among those having pride 
Then what kind of pathetic beings are they tell me please
 But those who hold on to their pride in order to triumph 
   over the enemy pride 
Are the holders of pride the triumphant heroes 
And those who kill off the enemy pride 
   even though its gargantuan 
Bestow then the fruit of triumph in full 
   on wandering beings whatever they wish
 So when standing amidst a horde of disturbing emotions 
I shall hold my ground proudly in a thousand ways 
And not be thrown off by the pack of disturbing emotions 
Like a lion with jackals and such
 Just as a person would protect his eyes 
When events of great danger actually arise 
Likewise Ill never fall under the power 
   of disturbing emotions 
When danger actually arises
 Let me be burned to death 
Or even have my head chopped off 
   that would be better 
But Ill never in any way 
Bow to the enemy disturbing emotions
Likewise in all situations 
I shall never do anything other than whats fit
 Like someone wishing for happiness as the result of play 
Any positive actions a bodhisattvas engaged in 
He clings to those actions 
And delights in those actions never having enough
 Although people do actions for the sake of happiness 
Its not clear that theyll become happy or not 
But for a bodhisattva whose actions in fact bring happiness 
How can he be happy without doing those actions
 If there can never be enough desirable sensory objects 
Though theyre like honey on a razors edge 
How can there ever be enough ambrosia of positive actions 
Which have as their ripening sweet happiness and peace
 So after completing a positive action 
Ill plunge into the action thats next right then 
Like an elephant parched by the midday sun 
When encountering a pond plunging into the water
 But following upon a decline in my strength 
Ill set my activity aside to take up again 
And having completed it well I shall leave it 
With thirst for the next and the next
 Then like engaging a sword in a duel 
With a seasoned opponent 
I shall parry the disturbing emotions thrusts 
And decisively stab my opponent the disturbing emotions
 Just as someone having dropped his sword in a duel 
Would snatch it up quickly out of fear 
So having dropped the sword of mindfulness 
I shall quickly snatch it up mindful of the fears 
   of the joyless realms
 Just as poison on the blade of a sword finding blood 
   as its carrier 
Spreads throughout the body 
Similarly a fault when finding an opening 
Spreads throughout the mind
 Like a terrified person carrying a jar filled with mustard oil 
With someone keeping in front poking with a sword 
Threatening to kill him if he spills a drop 
Someone with taming behavior needs likewise to hold on tight
 Therefore just as Id swiftly stand up 
At the slithering of a snake into my lap 
Likewise at the slithering in of sleepiness or lethargy 
I shall swiftly repulse it
 Scolding myself on each and every 
   occasion of a lapse 
I shall contemplate at length 
How can I act so that never again 
Will this happen to me
 With this as a motive How can I make it a habit 
To be mindful given those situations 
Ill aspire for the company of spiritual teachers 
Or the appropriate action that they give me to do
 Then the way to have force for all events 
Before doing some action is 
That Ill rally and invigorate myself 
Recalling the chapter on taking care
 Just as the wind coming and going 
Takes control of a cotton ball 
So shall I take control of myself with zestful vigor 
And gain in this way spiritual success
 Far-Reaching Mental Stability
Unedited Transcript
  Having increased my zestful vigor like that 
I shall set my mind in absorbed concentration 
Since a person having a distracted mind 
Is set between the fangs of disturbing emotions
 Through dissociating both my body and mind 
Therell be no occurrence of any distraction 
Therefore Ill set aside worldly concerns 
And bring my rambling thought to a halt
 Worldly concerns are not discarded 
Because of sticky attachments 
   and thirst for material gain and the like 
Therefore to set these things aside 
Someone with knowledge would discern like this:
 An exceptionally perceptive state of mind 
   joined onto a stilled and settled state 
Completely destroys the disturbing emotions 
Having understood this first I shall seek 
   a stilled and settled mind 
And thats achieved through delight in detachment 
from worldly concerns
 After all any impermanent person 
Having sticky attachment to impermanent beings 
Wont see those loved ones again after death 
For many thousands of lives 

 Not seeing them Ill be unhappy 
And my mind wont settle in absorbed concentration 
Even if Ive seen them Ill never be satisfied 
And as before Ill be tormented by longing
 From being attached to limited beings 
Im blocked from seeing things as they are 
I lose any sense of disillusionment too 
And in the end Im tormented by grief
 Because of thinking only of them 
This life will pass without any meaning 
And through noneternal friends and relations 
I will come to lose the eternal Dharma
 Having acted equal to the lot of infantile people 
Ill surely go to a worse rebirth state 
If Im led to a lot thats not even equal 
Then what have I gained by relying on those infantile folk
 One moment theyre friends 
In an instant theyre enemies 
At a time for being delighted they fall into a rage: 
Ordinary beings are so difficult to please
 Told whats of benefit they get enraged 
And cause me to turn from whats of benefit too 
But if their words arent listened to 
They fall into a rage and go then to a worse rebirth state
 Theyre envious of superiors competitive with equals 
Arrogant toward inferiors conceited when praised 
And hateful when told what they dont want to hear: 
When is there benefit from infantile beings
 If I associate with infantile people 
Then destructive behavior inevitably arises 
   among infantile folk 
Such as praising myself and belittling others 
And prattling on about the pleasures of samsara
 From entrusting myself to others in this way 
Nothing but loss comes about in the end 
For theyll be in fact no-good for me 
And Ill be in fact no-good for them
 So let me flee far away from infantile folk 
But if encountered Ill please them with pleasantries 
And without becoming overly familiar 
Ill conduct myself nicely merely as an ordinary person would
 Obtaining only whats helpful for Dharma 
Like a bumblebee honey from a flower 
Ill live without having familiars 
Like having never seen any of them before
 But I get a lot of material gain and honor 
And many people like me 
If I hold on to being conceited like that 
Terrifying things will arise after death
 Thus no matter what my bewildered mind 
Becomes attached to 
In conjunction with each of them 
Thousandfold problems arise and stay around
 Hence the wise have no attachments 
Because from attachments terrifying things arise 
As these objects will naturally be discarded at death 
Be firm and consider this well:
 Thereve been many people with material wealth 
And thereve been many with fame and reputation 
But its never been known that theyve passed on to some place 
Where their amassed wealth and fame have come with
 If there are others who belittle me 
What pleasure is there when Im being praised 
And if there are others who praise me 
What displeasure is there when Im being belittled
 If limited beings with varied dispositions 
Couldnt be pleased by even the Triumphant 
What need to mention by the poor likes of me 
Therefore let me give up my preoccupation 
   with worldly people
 They belittle limited beings lacking material gain 
And regarding those with material gain they say bad things 
How can any pleasure arise with those 
Whose company is by nature so difficult
 The Thusly Gone Buddha has said 
An infantile person isnt anyones friend 
Thats because the friendliness of an infantile person 
Doesnt arise except through its serving his own self-aims
Friendliness through the gateway of its serving self-aims 
Is friendliness just for the aims of a self 
Just as distress at the breaking of some material possession 
Is something in fact that comes from a loss of self-pleasure
 In forests however wild creatures birds and trees 
Never say bad things about you 
And are happy when befriended 
When shall I come to live with them
 Oh when shall I become detached 
Living in caves an empty shrine 
Or at the foot of a tree 
And never look back
 When shall I come to live in nature 
In vast regions not privately owned 
Moving under my own incentive or 
Staying put without attachment
 When shall I come to live without fears 
Having just a few small things 
   a clay begging bowl and the like 
Wearing clothes that no one would want 
And not even sheltering this body
 When having gone to a charnel ground 
Shall I come to compare 
With the piles of others bones 
My body having the nature to rot
 This very body of mine 
Will also become putrid like that 
And because of its stench 
Not even the jackals will slink near
 Though this body was born as a single object 
The flesh and bones that arose with it 
Will fall apart and go their own ways 
What need to mention friends that are other than it
 A man is born alone when taking birth 
And dies alone too when undergoing death 
As no one else can take a share of this pain 
What can be done by encumbering friends
 Just as the way in which travelers on a road 
Take up a place to lodge 
Similar is the way in which travelers on the road 
   of compulsive existence 
Take up a rebirth as a place to lodge
 So let me retire to the forest 
Until four pallbearers 
Haul that body out from there 
While all my worldly relations grieve
 Let this body stay there in isolation alone 
Making neither intimate friends nor conflicts 
If Im already counted as if I were dead 
Therell be no mourners when I actually die
 As therell be no attendants hovering nearby 
Mourning and causing distress 
Therell be no one to distract this hermit 
From continuing mindfulness of Buddha and more
 So let me live in solitude 
In lovely delightful forests 
With little trouble happiness and well-being 
Quieting all distractions
 Having cast off all other intentions 
And with my intent single-pointed 
I shall strive there for settling my mind 
   in absorbed concentration 
And making it tamed
 For lustful desires give rise to disasters 
In this world and in the next ones as well 
In this one they bring about murder imprisonment 
   and knifings 
And in the next joyless realms and the like
 Those bodies for which sake 
   you repeatedly begged 
Before male and female go-betweens 
And for which sake you didnt shrink 
From either negative behavior or disgrace
 For which you threw yourself even in danger 
And even spent all your wealth 
And embracing which 
You experienced the utmost pleasure of sexual release -
 They were nothing but skeletons 
Independent and never yours 
Why not push on instead to nirvanic release 
Which you can fully embrace to your hearts content
 That face which at your wedding you lifted up first with effort 
    and drew near 
Although it was bashfully looking down 
And whether previously seen or not seen by you 
Was covered with a veil
 That face which emotionally disturbed you so 
Is now unveiled by the vultures 
And can be directly seen 
Why do you run away now
 That face which you protected before 
From the leers of others eyes 
Why arent you protecting it now jealous miser 
While its being devoured by them
 Seeing this pile of meat 
Being gulped down by vultures and the rest 
Tell me is the food of others something to be offered 
With garlands of flowers jewelry and sandalwood scent 
  
 If you experience fright from seeing even a skeleton 
Though it lacks any movement 
Why wasnt there horror when it was set into motion 
By some intent like a zombie
 You lusted after it even when it was covered 
Why dont you lust for it now when uncovered from its skin 
If you have no use for it now 
Why did you sexually embrace it when covered
 Its excrement and saliva 
Arise from one and the same food 
So why out of the two do you take no delight 
   in the excrement 
And yet delight in a taste of saliva
 Finding no sexual pleasure in pillows 
Filled with cotton and soft to the touch 
After all They dont exude a foul stench 
Lustful people are bewildered about excrement
 Lustful gross bewildered people 
Thinking Its impossible to make love 
To cotton soft to the touch 
Become furious with it instead
 If you have no attachment for what is foul 
Why do you sexually embrace another body: 
A cagework of bones bound together with sinews 
And plastered over with a mud of flesh
 You yourself contain plenty of excrement 
So manage by yourself steadfastly with that 
Glutton for excrement 
You long for yet another bag of excrement
 Thinking But its the flesh I delight in 
You long to touch and look at it 
But why have you no desire for the flesh 
Here in its natural state devoid of a mind
 And whatever mind you might desire 
Cannot be touched or looked at 
And whatever can hasnt a consciousness 
So its no use Why do you sexually embrace it
 Though its no great surprise that you dont understand 
That anothers body by nature is something full of excrement 
But that you dont understand that your very own 
Is by nature something full of excrement – thats really shocking
 Having rejected the tender lotus born from the muck 
And opened by the rays of the unclouded sun 
What delight is there in a cagework of bones full of feces 
For a mind obsessed with excrement
 If you dont wish to touch soil and places 
That are smeared with excrement 
How is it that you wish to touch the body 
Out of which it was excreted
 If you have no attachment for what is foul 
Why do you sexually embrace another body: 
The seed of which grew from a field full of excrement 
And was nourished by it
 Is it because of its tininess that you dont long 
For a foul maggot born from excrement 
You desire in fact a body also born from excrement 
Since by nature its full of a lot of excrement
 Not only do you not disparage 
The excremental nature of yourself 
You glutton for excrement 
You long for other bags of excrement too
 Whether its refreshing chews with camphor and the like 
Or cooked rice with vegetable curries 
Once put in the mouth and then spat out or vomited 
Even the ground becomes filthy and foul
 If you still have doubts about its being like this 
In the nature of excrement though its so obvious 
Look at the ghastly foul bodies of others 
Thrown away in the charnel ground
 When the skin is torn open 
Great horror comes up from it 
Knowing just that how can delight 
Come up any more from that very same thing
 And that smell sloshed on the body 
Is from sandalwood and such things 
   not from the other person 
So why are you attracted to someone else 
By the smell of something other
 If because of its naturally foul smell 
Theres no attraction to it isnt that fortunate 
Why do people in this world who relish whats useless 
Slosh it with sweet smelling things
 Well then if what has the sweet smell is sandalwood 
What comes from the body in this case 
So why are you attracted to someone else 
By the smell of something other
 If the natural state of the body is totally horrific - 
Naked coated with a tarnish of grime 
Its hair and nails long 
Its teeth yellow and stained -
 Why spruce it up with so much hard work 
Like a weapon for inflicting self-harm 
Oh dear this world is truly bustling with madmen 
Working so hard deluding themselves
 Having seen merely a few skeletons 
You were so turned off in the charnel ground 
Yet you find sexual pleasure in charnel-ground cities 
Crowded with moving skeletons
 Further that bag full of excrement like that 
Isnt obtained without a price: 
Theres exhaustion in earning money for its sake 
And torment later in joyless realms and the like
 Its not possible to build up wealth as a child 
So as a teenager what is there to get pleasure with 
Spending adulthood accumulating wealth 
What can an old person do with sexual desires
 Some people though having gross desires 
Exhaust themselves with work all day long 
And coming home at night their bodies spent 
Drop down asleep like the dead
 Some must go abroad on army expeditions 
And with disturbing emotions have the suffering of being 
   far away 
Longing for their children and wives they dont see 
Their children and wives though the years roll by
 Confused by desires for what would be of self-benefit 
They even sell themselves for the sake of that 
Which they never obtain and so toil pointlessly 
Driven by the winds of others karmic whims
 And the wives of some of those who have sold 
   their own bodies 
And must follow others orders powerlessly 
Have to give birth to their children with them plopping out 
At the feet of trees or in desolate places
 Some foolish people deceived by desires 
Wishing to make a livelihood thinking Ill earn a living 
Enter into war thus risking their lives 
Or go into servitude for the sake of self-gain
 Some having greed are even bodily mutilated 
And some get impaled on spikes 
Some are seen being stabbed with daggers 
And some even burned alive
 With the torments involved in amassing protecting and losing it 
Know that material advantage is a disadvantage without an end: 
For those distracted by obsession with wealth 
Havent the time to free themselves 
   from the sufferings of compulsive existence
 Thus for those with desire drawbacks like these and more 
   are abundant 
And any tastes of pleasure are paltry 
Like the snatches of a few mouthfuls of grass 
Won by an ox while pulling a cart
 For the sake of that paltry taste of pleasure 
Not hard to find for even an ox 
This hard-to-find splendor of respites and endowments 
Is destroyed by those who waste their good karma
 Whatever hardships there are in exhausting yourself 
All the time for the sake of the puny desires of the body 
That will definitely perish and consequently 
Fall to joyless realms and worse
 With one millionth of the hardship there would be Buddhahood 
Whereas those with desires have suffering 
Greater than those engaged in bodhisattva behavior 
And yet they have no enlightenment
 Neither weapons poison fire 
Precipices nor foes 
Compare with desires when I think 
Of the tortures of joyless realms and the like
 Recoiling from desires in this way 
I shall enhance my delight in solitude 
In peaceful forests 
Devoid of strife and emotional disturbance
 Amongst beautiful boulders 
Huge as palaces cooled by the sandalwood rays of the moon 
Joyfully roam the fortunate ones fanned by the silent gentle 
   forest breezes 
Reflecting on the aims of benefiting others
 Staying anywhere for as long as desired - 
In an empty shelter at the foot of a tree or in caves - 
Those rid of the strain of safeguarding possessions 
Live relaxed without any cares
 Acting according to their own intent 
Without attachments not bound by anyone 
Savoring the joy of contentment 
Difficult to find for even powerful rulers
 Having considered with aspects such as these and more 
The benefits of dissociating myself 
And thus fully quieting my rambling thoughts 
I shall meditate on bodhichitta
 First I shall meditate strongly on 
The equality of myself and others in this way: 
As everyones a fellow being having happiness and pain 
Others are to be cared for by me in the same way as I am
 Just as despite its many parts with divisions into hands and so on 
The bodys to be cared for as a whole 
Similarly despite the differences among wandering beings 
Yet in regard to happiness and pain theyre all equal to myself 
   in wishing to be happy and thus form a whole
 Although my own pain 
Doesnt hurt the bodies of others 
Yet being like that the pain of a me 
Its unbearable because of clinging to a me
 Likewise though the pain of others 
Doesnt befall me 
Yet being like that the pain of a me 
Its also difficult to bear because of clinging to a me
 Thus the pain of others is something to be eliminated by me 
Because of its nature as pain like the pain of a me 
And others are beings to be helped by me 
Because of their natures as limited beings like the body of a me
 When happiness is something equally liked 
Both by myself and others 
Whats so special about me 
That I strive after happiness for myself alone
 And when suffering is something equally disliked 
Both by myself and others 
Whats so special about me 
That I take care of myself and not others
 If its because their suffering doesnt harm me 
That I dont safeguard them 
Why safeguard myself against future life suffering 
If it doesnt harm me now
 That notion is distorted that thinks 
But Im the one wholl experience it 
For like this its someone else who has died 
And someone else who takes birth
 If whatever suffering anyone has 
Must be taken care of by that one himself 
Then since the foots suffering is not the hands 
Why is that to be taken care of by it
 If its the case that ignoring it would be illogical 
And so here its undertaken from a sense of a whole self 
Well then surely whats illogical regarding the whole 
   formed by myself and others 
Is something to be dismissed as much as I can
 What are called a continuum and a group 
Such as a rosary an army and the like
   are not truly a findable whole 
And so since a possessor of suffering doesnt exist 
Whose responsibility is it as mine
 In their being without an owner 
All sufferings lack a distinction: 
So its simply because theyre suffering 
   that theyre to be averted 
Why are there fixed limitations made here
 But why is the suffering of everyone to be averted 
Well its indisputable: 
If anyones is to be averted then everyones is to be averted 
If not that applies to me as well 
   just like to every other limited being
 But with compassion theres much suffering 
So why develop it with such effort 
Well having thought about the sufferings of wandering beings 
How could the suffering of compassion be much
 If the suffering of many disappears 
Through the suffering of one 
That suffering would be something that someone 
   with loving compassion 
Would bring on for the sake of himself and others
 Thus Supushpa-chandra 
Though knowing the punishment hed receive from the king 
Didnt avoid the suffering for himself 
In order to dispel the sufferings of many
 Those with mental continuums accustomed like this 
And who hold equally dear quelling the sufferings of others 
Plunge themselves into even a joyless realm of unrelenting pain 
Like a swan into a lotus pond
 And then as limited beings are liberated 
   they have oceans of joy: 
These are the ones whove gained real fulfillment 
Wouldnt that be sufficient 
What is there with the wish for insipid liberation
 Thus even though working for the benefit of others 
Theres no conceit theres no amazement 
Theres no hoping for a ripened result for oneself 
When its with an appetite exclusively for what benefits others
 Therefore just as I safeguard myself 
Against becoming debased to the tiniest extent 
Likewise I shall act like that toward others 
With a protective mind and a mind of compassion
 Just as out of familiarity 
Theres an understanding of a me 
Regarding drops of semen and blood 
   belonging to others 
Despite its not existing as some thing
 Why couldnt I likewise take as me 
A body that belongs to someone else 
After all its not difficult to set it in the same way 
As something other than a body thats mine
 So having understood the faultiness of cherishing myself 
And the oceans of advantages of cherishing others 
I shall meditate on discarding my way 
Of taking a me and extend it to others
 Just as the hand and so on are held dear 
Through their being the limbs of the body 
Why couldnt beings having a body be similarly held dear 
Through their being limbs of wandering life
 Just as out of familiarity an attitude of me 
Has come about with respect to this body of mine 
   despite its lacking a me 
Likewise out of familiarity why couldnt an attitude of me 
Arise with respect to other limited beings as well
 Even though working like that for the benefit of others 
Amazement or conceit doesnt arise: 
Its like the hope for a reward doesnt arise 
From feeding food to myself
 Therefore just as I safeguard myself 
Against becoming debased to the tiniest extent 
Likewise Ill habituate myself to having 
A protective mind and a mind of compassion 
   toward all wandering beings
 Thats why out of great compassion the Guardian 
   Avalokiteshvara 
Has elevated even the power of his own name 
To dispel the fears of wandering beings 
Such as shyness in front an audience
 So I shall not turn away from whats difficult to do 
Since through the force of familiarity like this 
That very person whose name I was even afraid to hear 
Can become someone without whom I can have no joy
 Thus anyone who wishes to give safe direction 
Swiftly to himself and others 
Needs to practice the most sacred secret: 
The exchange of self with others
 Because of sticky attachment to this body as me  
From even small situations for fear fear arises 
So who wouldnt reject like a fear-inspiring foe 
Such a body as me
 This body which with the wish to remedy 
Afflictions such as hunger thirst and the like 
Kills fowl fish and deer 
And hides by the road in ambush to steal
 And which because of profit and shows of respect 
Would murder even its father and mother 
And by stealing the property of the Triple Gem 
Would burn in a joyless realm of unrelenting pain -
 What wise man would desire protect 
And venerate such a body as me 
Who wouldnt view it as a foe 
And not scorn it
 If I were to give what would I have to enjoy myself 
Such thinking of my own self-aims is the way of clutching ghosts 
If I were to enjoy it myself what would I have to give 
Such thinking of the aims of others is a quality of the divine
 Paining others for my own self-aims 
Ill be tormented in joyless realms and the like 
But paining myself for the aims of others 
Ill acquire all glories
 Through the wish for just myself to advance 
Come the worse rebirth states low status and stupidity 
But transferring that very wish to others 
Brings the better rebirth states honor and intelligence
 Ordering others around for my own self-aims 
Ill experience being a servant and worse 
But ordering myself around for the aims of others 
Ill experience being a lord and better
 All whosoever who are happy in the world 
Are so through the wish for the happiness of others 
While all whosoever who are miserable in the world 
Are so through the wish for the happiness of themselves
 But what need is there to elaborate more 
Just look at the difference between the two: 
An infantile person acting for his own self-aims 
And Sage Buddha acting for the aims of others
 For those who havent exchanged their happiness 
For the sufferings of others 
Buddhahoodll be impossible to attain 
And therell be no happiness even in samsara
 Leave aside the hereafter not even the aims 
Of this seeable life will be fulfilled 
For a waged servant not doing his work 
And a master not paying his wages
 Dropping the production of happiness for one another - 
A festival of glorious happiness in this seeable life 
   and unseeable beyond - 
Bewildered people grab hold instead of unbearable suffering 
Because of causing suffering to one another
 Whatever violence there is in the world 
And as much fear and suffering as there is 
All of it arises from grasping at a self: 
So what use is that terrible demon to me
 If I dont fully drop such a self 
I wont be able to drop my suffering 
Just as if I dont fully drop a fire 
I wont be able to drop being burned
 Therefore for the sake of quelling my own suffering 
And for quelling the sufferings of others as well 
I shall give myself over to others 
And take others on as myself
 O mind decide for sure 
Im under the governance of others 
Except for the welfare of all limited beings 
Youre not going to have other intentions now
 Its inappropriate to look to accomplish my own self-aims 
With eyes and so on governed by others 
Its also inappropriate to dally improperly 
   for my own self-aims 
With hands eyes and so on given over to them
 Taking limited beings as the boss through that view 
Whatever you see on this body of mine 
Rob each and every one of them 
And use it for the benefit of others
 Creating in lesser beings and so forth the sense of a me 
And creating in yourself the sense of others 
Meditate on envy rivalry and arrogance like this 
With a mind free from prejudiced thoughts:
 This ones shown respect but Im not 
I dont have wealth like this one has 
This ones praised but Im belittled 
This one has happiness but I have suffering
 I do all the work 
While this one lives a life of ease 
This ones renowned in the world as superior 
While I as inferior without any good qualities
 But how could any work be done 
   by someone having no good qualities 
Thus all of us possess good qualities 
And after all there are those among whom this one is inferior 
And there are those among whom Im in fact superior
 Such things as the decline of my ethical discipline and outlook 
Are due to disturbing emotions and not from their being 
   under my control 
I need to be healed to the best of his ability: 
I even readily accept the pain involved
 But not only does this one not treat me 
   as someone to be healed 
Why does he look down on me 
What use are his good qualities to me 
When this one is the me having good qualities
 With no compassion in this one for wandering beings 
Caught in the jaws of the carnivorous beast of the worse rebirth states 
And with arrogance instead toward everybody else 
   about his own good qualities 
He wants to outdo the skilled masters
 Perceiving me on his same level 
He would struggle to secure the material gain 
And show of respect that I have even through contentious means 
For the sake of increasing his own lead in any way
 But if my own good qualities 
Were to be evident throughout the whole world 
Then by contrast any good qualities this one might have 
Wouldnt be heard of by anyone
 And if my own shortcomings were to be concealed 
Then offerings would be made to me not to him 
Material gain today would be well accruing to me 
And honors would be coming to me not to this one
 And we would all look on with delight 
As this one finally is put down as incompetent 
Made the laughing stock of all wandering beings 
And reviled all around
 Further its come out that this deluded miserable being 
Is even enviously in competition with me 
But how could the learning intelligence physique 
   class or wealth 
Of this one be the equal of mine
 That being so and hearing 
My own good qualities proclaimed everywhere 
I shall feast on a banquet of joy 
So delighted that the hairs on my body 
   will stand up on end
 Even if this one might somehow 
   come to have material gain 
If hes doing work for us 
Hes to be given merely enough to live on 
And the rest is to be taken forcefully by us
 This one is to be brought down from his idle state of ease 
And invariably linked to the harms weve experienced 
For hundreds of times all around 
Weve been harmed in recurring samsara by this one
 O mind countless eons have passed 
In your obsessive quest for your own self-aims 
Yet with such enormous exhaustion as that 
All youve procured is just suffering
 Please definitely engage yourself like that 
Right now for the aims of others 
Then youll see the benefits of that in the future 
Since the words of the Sage are never wrong
 If in the past it would have occurred 
That you had taken this action 
Then a situation like this would never have occurred 
In which youve been freed instead of the bliss 
   of success as a Buddha
 Therefore just as youve placed the sense of a me 
Onto drops of the semen and blood of others 
Likewise make it a habit of placing it 
Onto those of others as well
 Having become a scout for others 
Whatever you see on this body of mine 
Rob each and every one of them 
And use it for the benefit of others
 This me is happy the others are unhappy 
This me is lofty the others are lowly 
This me does whats of self benefit others do not 
Thinking like that why wouldnt you engender 
   envy toward yourself
 So deprive yourself of your happiness 
And take onto yourself the sufferings of others 
Investigate whats the fault of this me by asking 
When does this one do anything for others
 Any mistake that others might make 
Transform it by seeing it as the fault of this me 
But any even minor mistake that this me might make 
Openly admit it to many people
 With declarations that the renown of others is superior 
Let it outshine the renown of this me 
And like the lowest of servants 
Set this me to doing whats of benefit for all
 Dont praise this naturally fault-ridden one 
For some tiny share of temporary good qualities 
Rather act such that none will ever know somehow 
Of any good qualities that this one might have
 In short any harmful act youve done to others 
For the sake of your own self-aims 
Let that very same harm descend on yourself 
For the sake of the aims of limited beings
 Never give any strengthening to this one 
So that he would become boisterous 
Make him instead behave like a newlywed bride 
Bashful timid and restrained
 Do that Remain like that 
Dont you ever act like that 
This ones to be brought under control like that 
And knocked down if he ever transgresses beyond that
 But even when being instructed like that 
If you dont act in that way O mind 
Then since all wrongs depend on you 
Its exactly you whom I shall knock down
 That time before was different 
When I was being ruined by you 
But now I see you so where can you go 
Im going to knock all the arrogance out of you
 Throw away now any hope 
I still have my own self-interest 
Ive sold you to others so dont think 
   of your weariness 
Ive offered your energies to them
 If because of not caring 
I dont hand you over to limited beings 
Then for sure youll hand me over 
To the guards of the joyless realms
 Ive been handed over like that 
Many times by you and long tormented 
But now recalling those grudges 
I shall smash you you creature of self-interest
 If you want self-happiness 
Dont work for happiness in yourself 
If you want self-protection 
Protect always others
 To whatever degree 
This body is pampered 
To that degree it degenerates 
To a state of becoming ever more dainty
 And when its degenerated like that 
Not even this entire wealth-bearing earth 
Has the ability to fulfill its longings 
So who will be able to grant its desires
 For someone desiring the impossible 
Disturbing emotion and the dashing of hopes 
   come about 
But for someone having no hopes for anything 
His fulfillment never knows an end
 Therefore dont leave the chance open 
For an increase in desire concerning the body 
That object is best which isnt taken 
Because of its being desirable
 It winds up as ashes in the end 
And even when alive being inert 
   its set into motion by something else - 
This filthy form is truly ghastly 
Why grasp to it as mine
 Whether its alive or dead 
What use is this device to me 
What difference does it have 
   from a lump of clay and such things 
But oh no youre not removing 
   your pride of identifying with it
 Suffering accumulates pointlessly 
Through being partial toward the body 
So what use is being fawning or angry 
Over this thing that resembles a block of wood
 Whether nurtured by me in this way 
Or devoured by vultures and such 
It doesnt have sticky attachment or anger 
So why do I have sticky attachment to it
 Something getting furious at being belittled 
Or something getting pleased at being praised - 
If it doesnt know to be either of these 
For whom am I exhausting myself
 But those who desire this body - 
They and I are friends 
Well since everyone desires the body of oneself 
Why arent they as dear to me too
 Therefore without partiality this bodys 
   been given over by me 
For the benefit of wandering beings 
Nevertheless though it has many faults 
It needs to be held like a tool for the job
 So enough of behaving like an infant 
Im following in the footsteps of the wise 
Thus recalling the teaching on taking care 
I shall turn back sleepiness and being muddleheaded
 Like the compassionate offspring of the Triumphant 
I shall bear the rigors of whats appropriate to do 
For if I dont make a constant effort day and night 
When will my suffering ever come to an end
 Therefore withdrawing my mind from distorted pathways 
I shall continuously set it in absorbed concentration 
On the perfect object 
In order for its obscurations to be gone
 Far-Reaching Discriminating Awareness
Unedited Transcript
 The Sage has spoken about all these branches 
For the sake of discriminating awareness 
Therefore generate discriminating awareness 
With the wish to pacify sufferings
 Surface and deepest 
These are accepted as being the two truths 
The deepest arent cognitive objects of the dualistic mind 
The dualistic mind is spoken of in terms of the surface
 In light of that the world is seen to be of two types: 
Yogis and common people 
And regarding that the world of common people 
Is undermined by the yogi world
 Through differences in their intelligence 
Yogis too are undermined by progressively higher ones 
By means of examples accepted by both and because 
When not scrutinizing both accept that causes function 
   for the sake of the result
 Functional phenomena are seen by the common world 
And conceptualized to be absolutely existent 
And not like an illusion Its in this regard 
That theres dispute between the yogis and the common world
 But even form and so on 
   as perceived by straightforward cognition itself 
Is established only by popular consensus and not by valid cognition 
And thats false like the popular consensus that 
Whats unclean and so forth is clean and so on
 For the sake of causing the common world to enter 
The Guardian Buddha has taught that there are 
   truly existent functional phenomena 
Their actual nature however is that they arent momentary things 
Suppose like the Sautrantikas you objected 
   But its supposed to contradict the common surface view
 Well  surface truth asserted by yogis has no fault 
And thats a seeing of their actual nature in contrast with 
   the common worlds view 
Otherwise their ascertainment of the uncleanliness 
   of a womans body for instance 
Would be undermined by the common world
 Furthermore from Triumphant Ones who are like an illusion 
   comes positive force 
In the same way as if they actually were 
   truly existent functional phenomena 
Suppose you objected But if a limited being were like an illusion 
Then how could he take rebirth once having died
 Well so long as conditions are gathered together 
For that long an illusion lasts as well 
And how could a limited being be truly existent 
Merely because his continuity lasts longer
 In murdering and so on a person that is actually an illusion 
Theres no negative force since it hasnt a mind 
But with someone having the type of illusion a mind actually is 
Positive and negative forces accrue
 Because mantras and so forth lack the ability 
They cannot produce an actual illusory mind 
And even that illusory one 
   that arises from varying conditions 
Is of varying sorts 
Since nowhere is there one condition 
Having the ability for producing all
 Suppose you asked  
If in deepest truth someone were released in natural nirvana 
And in surface truth were circling in samsara 
Then since Buddha as well would be circling in samsara 
What use would there be with bodhisattva behavior
 Well even an illusion cannot be turned back 
Unless the continuity of its conditions is cut 
Yet when the continuity of its conditions is cut 
It doesnt arise even in surface truth
 Suppose like the Chittamatrins you then asked 
When even the deceptive awareness of it doesnt truly exist 
By what is the illusion being focused on 
Well when the illusion itself doesnt externally exist 
   according to you 
Then on what is it being focused
 Suppose you answered 
In actuality it exists as something else: 
Its an aspect of mind itself 
Well when mind itself is what the illusion actually is 
Then whats being seen by what
 Its been said by the Guardian for the World in fact 
Mind cannot see mind 
Just as the edge of a sword cannot cut itself 
So it is with the mind
 Suppose you responded 
But its just like how a candle flame 
Perfectly illuminates itself as a phenomenon 
Well the flame of a candle isnt being illuminated 
Since its not something that had been obscured by darkness
 Suppose you replied 
Well a blue object for example doesnt depend on something else 
For its being blue as does a clear crystal 
So like this some things are seen that depend on another 
And some that do not so depend
 Well when something is an example of non-blue 
It cant make itself blue by itself 
And what blue object 
Can make itself blue by itself
 Suppose you persisted 
But as its cognized by a cognition 
It can be said The candle flame is illuminating itself 
Well upon its being cognized by what 
   can that statement be made 
A mind is illuminating itself
 And when its never been seen by anyone 
Then discussing whether its self luminous 
Or not self luminous is meaningless 
Like the beautiful looks of the daughter of a barren woman
 Suppose you insisted 
But if reflexive awareness doesnt exist 
Then how does a consciousness come to be recalled 
Well a recollection comes about from a connection 
With another object that was experienced like the poison from a rat
 And suppose you persisted 
But it can illuminate itself because 
When endowed with other conditions 
   theres the seeing of others minds 
Well a buried treasure vase thats seen from applying 
   actualized magic eye lotion 
Still wouldnt be the eye lotion itself
 How something is seen heard or known 
Is not being nullified in this at all 
Here instead conceptual cognition of it as truly existent 
   which has become the cause for suffering 
Is being turned back   
 Suppose you said 
An illusion of an external object isnt different from the mind 
Yet it cant be conceived as non-different 
Well if it were a truly existent functional phenomenon 
   how could it not be different 
And if you said its not different 
   it couldnt be a truly existent functional phenomenon
 Just as an illusion though not truly existent can still be seen 
So too is it with what does the seeing 
Suppose you still objected But samsara must have a truly existent 
   functional phenomenon as its support 
Otherwise it would be like space
 Well how could a non-phenomenon come to have a function 
Through its being supported on a truly existent functional one 
And the mind you asserted would get reduced in fact 
To something existing alone by itself accompanied by nothing
 And when the mind would be naturally free of cognized objects 
Then everyone would be a Thusly Gone Buddha 
And if that were the case what benefit would there be 
In conceiving of mind-only
 Suppose you asked 
Even upon knowing the similarity of things with illusion 
How does disturbing emotion turn back 
When its the case that lust for an illusory woman 
Can arise even in the one who conjured her
 Well that happens because the conjurer hasnt rid himself yet 
Of the habit for disturbing emotion toward knowable things 
And so when he sees her 
His habit for voidness is still weak in force
 However by habituating himself to the habit of voidness 
Hell rid himself of the habit of cognizing phenomena 
   as truly existent 
Then by habituating himself with not existing at all 
Hell later come to rid himself even of cognizing that
 When a truly existent functional phenomenon 
   which is conceived as not existing 
Is no longer taken as the mental aim 
Then lacking a support how can the nonfunctional phenomenon 
   of its non-true existence 
Remain before the dualistic mind
 When neither a truly existent functional phenomenon 
   nor the nonfunctional one of its non-true existence 
Remains before the dualistic mind 
Then since the other alternatives cannot be the case 
Theres full pacification into a state without mental aim 
   at the impossible
 Then just as a wish-fulfilling gem 
And a wish-granting tree fulfill all wishes 
Likewise through the power of disciples to be tamed and of prayers 
The Enlightening Form of a Triumphant One appears
 For example just as when a garudika healer 
   has passed away 
After actualizing a wooden healing post 
It still can pacify poison and the like 
Even when a long times expired since his passing
 So too when a bodhisattva has passed into nirvana 
After actualizing the healing-post body of a Triumphant One 
In accord with bodhisattva behavior 
It still can perform all thats to be done
 Suppose you asked 
How can offerings made to something lacking a mind 
   have results 
Well why Because whether hes still here 
Or has already passed into nirvana 
Its been proclaimed as being the same
 According to scriptural authority results are there 
Whether from the surface viewpoint or that of actuality 
Its like for example how youd say that offerings made 
To a truly existent Buddha has results
 Suppose like the Hinayanists you then objected 
But since liberation comes from seeing the four noble truths 
Whats the use of seeing voidness 
Well why Because from scriptural authority its been proclaimed 
That without this path theres no purified state
 Suppose you then objected 
But Mahayanas not established as valid 
Well how can your scriptures be established 
If you answered Because theyre established for both parties 
Well they werent established for you from the start
 Any criterion that would give confidence in them 
Would equally apply to the Mahayana ones too 
And if acceptance by two different parties 
   could make something true 
Then the Vedas and so on would also become true
 Suppose you argued 
Its because the Mahayana ones are disputed 
Well because your scriptures are disputed by non-Buddhists 
And some other sections within your scriptures 
   by yourselves and others 
Theyd have to be discarded too
 Suppose you said 
But the teachings of the four noble truths 
   are the root of the absolute monkhood of arhats 
Well even absolute monkhood itself is on difficult grounds 
Since the nirvana of a mind still aimed at the impossible 
Is on difficult grounds
 Suppose you replied 
But theyve become liberated because theyve rid themselves 
   of disturbing emotion 
Well that would need to have happened immediately upon that 
However its seen that despite their lacking disturbing emotion 
Theyre still under the power of karma
 Suppose you then said 
But its definite that they dont have still to some extent 
Craving as a condition for obtaining rebirth 
Well why couldnt it be that a craving 
   thats not with disturbing emotion 
Is still existing in them while still with bewilderment about all
 Through the circumstance of feeling theres craving 
And feeling still exists in them as well 
So a mind still having an aim at the impossible 
Will come to be settled on one or another
 A mind thats parted from voidness 
May block it but itll arise once again 
As with a trance that lacks distinguishing 
Therefore one needs to meditate on voidness
 So again if you accept as spoken by the Buddha 
Any speech thats made it down into the sutras 
Then why not accept the Mahayana which 
   for the most part 
Are equivalent to your sutras
 If because of one exception 
All would become corrupt 
Then why because of one equivalence to your sutras 
Wouldnt all have been spoken by the Buddha
 And who would consider unacceptable 
Some speech the depths of which 
Even Mahakashyapa and the like couldnt fathom 
Simply because you cant understand it
 After all the fruit of realizing voidness is this: 
Through freedom from the extremes of attachment and fear 
Being able to stay in samsara 
For the sake of those suffering from being bewildered
 As its like this derisions improper 
In the direction of voidness 
Therefore without indecisively wavering 
Meditate please on voidness
 Voidness is the opponent for the darkness 
Of the emotional and cognitive obscurations 
So how can someone wishing for omniscience quickly 
Not meditate on it
 Cognizing phenomena as truly existent 
   gives rise to suffering: 
Generate fear for that 
But realizing voidness pacifies suffering: 
So why does fear generate for that
 Go ahead and be afraid of whatever 
If there were something called a me 
But as theres nothing that is a me 
Then whose fear will it be
 Teeth hair or nails are not a me 
Nor am I bones or blood 
Im neither mucous nor phlegm 
And nor am I lymph or pus
 I am not fat or sweat 
Nor am I even lungs or a liver 
Im not any of the other inner organs 
Nor am I feces or urine
 Flesh or skin is not a me 
Nor am I temperature or energy-wind 
In no way am I ever a bodily hole 
Nor are the six types of consciousness a me
 And if a person were a permanent cognizer 
   as Samkhya asserts and of a sound 
The sound would be cognized all of the time 
But when bereft of something it cognizes what does it know 
By means of which it could be called a cognizer
 If it could be a cognizer without cognizing something 
Then absurdly a stick would also be a cognizer 
Therefore its certain that without something nearby 
   that its cognizing 
It cant be a cognition
 Suppose you said 
It itself is then cognizing a sight 
Well why doesnt it also hear at that time 
If you answered Because the sounds not nearby 
Well then its no longer a cognizer of it
 How can something having the nature 
   of the cognizer of a sound 
Become the cognizer of a sight 
One can be labeled a father and a son 
But not as his absolute nature
 And its like this because sattva rajas and tamas 
   as the absolute nature of both a sound and a sight 
Are neither a son nor are they a father 
And because that cognizer of a sight has never been seen 
With a fundamental nature connected with a cognizer of a sound
 Suppose you persisted 
Like a dancer its still itself 
   but seen with another mode of guise 
Well then it wouldnt be static 
And suppose you clarified Its still itself 
   but its fundamental nature is in another mode 
Well then its oneness is one without any precedent
 Suppose you explained 
But its assorted modes of guise are not true 
Then describe please its own innate natural guise 
Suppose you answered Its being a cognizer 
Well then absurdly it would follow that all persons are one
 Further what has intention and what lacks intention - 
    those two would in fact become one thing 
Because their existence is the same 
And if individualities were contrary to fact 
Then what could be their shared support
 Furthermore something lacking intention 
   cannot be a self as Nyaya-Vaisheshika asserts 
Because of its nature of lack of intention 
   just like a vase and such things 
Now suppose you claimed Its cognizant 
   because of a conjunction with an intention 
Then it absurdly follows that this noncognizant self 
   has perished
 And if the self were in fact unchanging 
What could have been done to it 
   through a connection with an intention 
Moreover space is noncognizant and inert like that 
So it as well could become a self
 Suppose you then objected 
But without the true existence of a static self 
The connection between behavioral cause and effect 
   would be unreasonable 
Since if it perished after having done an action 
Then whose action would it have been
 Well since its established for both of us 
That the action and result have a different basis 
And that the self hasnt an active role in this 
Isnt it useless to debate on this point
 Someone providing a causal action and conjoined 
   with its result - 
This has never been seen as an existent thing 
Its in reliance on the unity of a continuum 
   that it is taught 
Only the agent can be the experiencer of the results
 The already-passed and the not-yet-arisen minds 
Are not the self since they dont exist now 
And well if the presently arising mind were the self 
When it perishes there would in fact be no self
 For example when the trunk of a plantain tree 
Is split into parts nothing is found 
Likewise when searched for with discerning analysis 
A self isnt found as an absolute thing
 Suppose you asked 
If a limited being didnt exist 
Toward whom could there be compassion 
Well it would be toward one who was conceptually labeled 
   by a bewildered mind 
That had committed itself to the goal of its fruit
 Suppose you then asked 
Whose fruit would it be if there were no limited being 
Well thats true Its accepted that the wish 
   is due to bewilderment 
Yet for the sake of pacifying suffering completely 
Bewilderment about the fruit is not turned back
 But because of bewilderment about the self 
The cause of suffering self-inflation increases 
Suppose you said But theres no turning back from that 
Well best is meditation on the lack of an impossible self
 A body is neither the feet nor the calves 
Nor is a body the thighs or the hips 
The belly or the back is not a body 
Neither is a body the chest or the arms
 The sides of the torso or the hands are not a body 
Nor is a body the armpits or the shoulders 
The inner organs as well are not it 
And neither is a body the head or also the neck 
So what alternative could a body be here
 If this body were located 
With a portion in all of these 
Then although the parts are located in the parts 
Where is it itself located
 And if a body itself in its entirety 
Were located everywhere in the hands and so forth 
There would be as many bodies 
As there were hands and so on
 As a bodys not located outside or inside the parts 
How could a body exist in terms of the hands and so forth 
   as their possessor 
As its also not a possessor separate from the hands and so on 
How could it possibly be truly existent
 Thus a bodys not truly existent 
But because of bewilderment 
   in terms of the hands and so forth 
A dualistic mind arises of a body 
Its like the dualistic mind that arises 
   of a man in terms of a scarecrow 
By its feature of having been set up in its shape
 For as long as the conditions are assembled 
The body of a scarecrow is seen as a man 
Likewise for as long as there are hands and so on 
A body is seen in terms of them
 Similarly because of its being a composite of fingers 
Which one could be a hand 
The same with that finger as well 
   because of its being a composite of joints 
And a joint as well from the breakdown into its own parts
 And a part as well through a breakdown into particles 
And that particle as well because of directional divisions 
And a directional division too because of its being 
   without findable parts like space 
Consequently even particles dont truly exist
 Therefore what discerning person would be attached 
To a bodily form which is like a dream 
And when like that a body doesnt truly exist 
Then whats a male and whats a female
 If suffering existed by absolute nature 
How is it that it doesnt 
   undermine experiencing pleasures 
And if happiness for those tormented by grief and the like 
   were a tasty dish or such things 
Why doesnt it make them delighted
 Suppose you answered 
Its not experienced because its outshone 
By something thats more intense 
Well how can something not in the nature of an experience 
Still be something in the category of a feeling
 Suppose you replied 
Couldnt it still be suffering but in a subtle state 
When its gross level has been displaced 
Well then you could also say that other than that 
   it was a slight level of joy 
And then absurdly its subtle state would be one of that too
 Suppose you said 
But at the arising of incompatible conditions 
Theres the non-arising of suffering 
Well doesnt that come down to establishing that 
A feeling is merely something hung on by a conceptual thought
 Because of just that this discerning analysis 
Needs to be meditated as its opponent 
The stability of mind that grows 
   from the field of examining 
Is the food of the yogis
 If theres a gap between 
   a cognitive sensor and its object 
Where could the meeting of the two occur 
And if theres no gap theyd be a fused unity 
So the meeting would be of what with what
 Yet there cant be penetration of a particle by a particle: 
Theyve no empty space and theyre of uniform size 
When theres no penetration theres no commingling 
And when theres no commingling theres no meeting
 Moreover for something thats partless 
How could what might be called a meeting 
   properly take place 
If a meeting and being partless can be observed together 
Then show it please
 For a consciousness which is immaterial 
A meeting is an impossibility 
Thats so for a composite as well 
   because it doesnt truly exist 
As has been discerningly analyzed before
 And so like that when contact doesnt truly exist 
From what does a feeling arise 
For what reason then is there all this trouble 
For whom and from what could injury come
 And when theres no truly existent one that feels 
And feeling as well doesnt truly exist 
Then seeing this situation O craving 
Why dont you turn yourself back
 Nevertheless something can be seen and also be touched 
Through its having a nature similar to a dream or an illusion
Further a feeling cannot be perceived by a mind 
From arising simultaneously with it
 And though a previous one can be remembered 
   by one that arises later 
It cant be experienced by it 
In short a feeling cant experience its own self 
And it cant be experienced by something else
 As theres no truly existent one that feels 
Then feeling cannot exist absolutely 
So in this bundle that lacks a true self 
Who can be injured by it
 A minds not situated in cognitive sensors 
   in sights and so on 
Nor in the space in between 
A mind isnt inside nor is it outside 
Nor can it be found in fact anywhere else
 Something that isnt the body nor something else 
Neither commingled nor separate in any way 
Isnt anything truly existent at all Because of that 
Limited beings are by nature released in parinirvana
 If the cognition of something were prior to what it cognized 
Then whats it to be aimed at for its arising to occur 
And if a cognition were simultaneous with what it cognized 
Still whats it to be aimed at for its arising to occur
 Yet if it occurred after what it cognized 
Then from what did the cognition of it arise 
Similarly it cant be determined that theres 
A truly existent arising of any phenomenon 

 Suppose you objected 
But if it were like that then surface true things 
   wouldnt exist at all 
And so how in this case could there be the two truths 
Moreover if they were being projected by others 
   as veiling surface truths 
Then how could there be someone with a limited mind 
   unveiled and released with nirvana
 Well this would be the deceptive conception 
    of the limited minds of others  
But that isnt surface truth from our own point of view 
Whats ascertained afterwards that still exists 
And if not then surface truth turns out to be something that doesnt exist
 And so whats conceptually examining and whats 
   conceptually examined 
The two of them are dependently supported one by the other 
And its by being dependently supported by whats in accord 
   with popular consensus 
That all analytical discernment is expressed
 But suppose you objected 
When one would need to analytically discern 
With a discernment that which has analytically discerned 
Then there would be an infinite regress 
   for that discernment as well 
Because of its need to be analytically discerned
 Well when whats analytically discerned is being discerned 
A supporting basis for that discernment doesnt exist 
And because of its being without a supporting basis 
   it doesnt arise: 
Thats called its natural release in nirvana
 And as for the likes of someone for whom 
   these two are truly existent 
He indeed is on very difficult grounds 
Because if its from the power of a cognition 
   that an objects established 
Then what supporting basis is there for establishing 
   the true existence of the cognition
 And if its from the power of whats cognized 
   that a cognition is established 
Then what support is there for establishing 
   the true existence of whats cognized 
On the other hand if their existence is established 
   by the power of each other 
Then the non-true existence of both would in fact be the case
 For example if without a child someone is not a father 
Then from whom can it arise that someone is a child 
Because in the absence of a child there can be no father 
Similar to that is the non-true existence of those two
 Suppose you asked 
A sprout grows from a seed 
And just as the true existence of the seed is indicated by it 
Why by the arising of a cognition from whats cognized 
Cant its true existence also be concluded
 Well when its from a cognition different from the sprout 
That it can be concluded that a seed exists 
What can it be from by means of which the true existence 
Of a cognition cognizing something it cognizes 
   can be concluded
 Charvakas please from straightforward cognition 
The common world in fact sees for itself everything causal 
After all a diversity of plants: lotus stalks and the like 
Grows by means of a diversity of causes
 Suppose you asked 
By what has the diversity of causes been made 
Well from a diversity of previous causes 
And suppose you asked further Because of what 
   does a cause have the ability to give rise to an effect 
Well its from the power of previous causes
 If as Nyaya-Vaisheshika asserts the Powerful Lord Ishvara 
   were the cause of the world 
So tell me what is Ishvara in fact 
If you said The elements then so be it 
But why all the fuss over merely a name
 However earth and the rest are multipart 
Nonstatic inert and not divine 
Theyre things to be walked over and unclean 
So that cant be the Powerful Lord Ishvara
 Ishvara cant be space because thats inert 
He cant be the self since thats been refuted before 
And even if you said The nature of being a creator 
   is in reference to something inconceivable 
Well then whats the use of talking about 
   something thats inconceivable
 And what could it be that he wished to create The self 
Well arent that the earth element and the rest 
And Ishvara supposed to be eternal by nature 
Moreover the arising of cognition from cognizable objects 
    
 Is without a beginning as is happiness and suffering 
   from karma 
So tell me whats been created by him 
And if theres no beginning to the cause 
How could there be a first instance of its effect
 And why doesnt he always create 
When he doesnt depend on anything else 
Theres nothing else existing not created by him 
So what is it on which he depends to create
 If what he depends on is a gathering of conditions 
Then again the Powerful Lord Ishvara would become 
   not the cause: 
For when theyre gathered hed lack the power 
   not to create 
And in their absence hed lack the power to create
 And if the Powerful Lord Ishvara must create 
   when not wanting to 
It absurdly follows that hes under the power of something else 
And if its when wanting to hes under the power of want 
So wheres the power of the Powerful Lord whos creating
 Those Mimamsakas who assert static particles 
   as the creator 
Have already been turned back before 
While the Samkhyas assert 
Static primal matter as the cause of the world
 For them the universal constituents 
Known as sattva/pleasure rajas/pain 
   and tamas/neutral sensation 
Abiding not in imbalance are called primal matter 
While their imbalance is said to be the world
 But its illogical for a partless unity 
   to be something threefold by nature 
And therefore it doesnt exist 
Likewise the universal constituents cant be truly existent 
Because each of them too has three aspects
 And in the absence of the universal constituents 
The true existence of sound and the rest becomes very farfetched 
Moreover its impossible for pleasure and so on 
To exist in non-conscious clothing and the likes
 Suppose you said 
Functional phenomena exist in the natural guise of their causes 
Well havent functional phenomena already been analyzed 
In any case the causes for you are pleasure and so on themselves: 
But cotton clothing and the likes dont arise from that at all
 And if pleasure and so on were to exist 
   from cotton clothing and the likes 
Then from their absence pleasure and so on wouldnt exist 
Moreover a static state of pleasure and so on 
Has never been focused upon
 If manifest pleasure and so on were truly existent statically 
Why isnt their experience always perceived 
Suppose you said The sensation itself 
   goes to a subtle unmanifest state 
Well how can it be both gross and subtle
 Since it would have become subtle and unmanifest 
   after having left its gross manifest state 
Its gross and subtle states are nonstatic 
So why not accept the nonstaticness like that 
Of all functional phenomena
 And if its gross manifest state were no different 
   from pleasure itself 
Then the nonstaticness of pleasure is obvious 
Suppose you asserted But something totally nonexistent in the cause 
Couldnt be produced because of its being nonexistent
 Well then production of something nonexistent 
   as a manifest object 
Would be the self-contradiction into which youre positioned 
   although you dont want it 
And if the effect were positioned in the cause 
Then a consumer of food would be an eater of excrement
 And for the price of cotton clothing 
Cottonseed could be bought and worn instead 
Suppose you said Although common people dont see it 
   because of bewilderment 
Precisely that is the position established by Kapila 
   the Knower of Reality
 Well cognition of that must also exist 
In common people so why isnt it seen 
Suppose you answered That lies in common peoples 
   Not being valid cognizers for that 
Well what they see as manifest then would also not be true
 Suppose you retorted 
But you too assert that a valid cognizer for the common world
   is not a valid cognizer for deepest truth 
And if thats the case then wouldnt what was validly cognized by it 
   also become false 
And therefore in actuality meditation on the voidness 
Of functional phenomena by it become incorrect   
 Well yes but when functional phenomena
   labeled and conceptually analyzed are not contacted 
The nonfunctional phenomenon of their nontrue existence 
   would also not be grasped 
Therefore concerning any truly existent 
   functional phenomenon thats false 
The falsehood of the nonfunctional phenomenon 
   of its nontrue existence would be obvious
 Thus upon the death of a son in a dream 
The conceptual thought that he doesnt exist 
Stops the arising of the conceptual thought 
That he does exist and yet it is false
 Therefore with discerning analysis like this 
Nothing exists thats from no cause at all 
Or thats sitting there fixed in conditions 
Whether separate ones or combined
 In fact nothing has come from something else 
And nothing remains and nothing goes 
So anything taken as truly existent by bewildered minds 
What difference does it have from an illusion
 So examine something emanated by illusion 
And something emanated by causes: 
Where does it come from 
Where does it go
 How can there be true existence 
In some virtual object like a reflection 
Which is seen only in conjunction with something else 
And which doesnt exist when thats absent
 For a functional phenomenon that was truly existing 
What need would there be for a cause 
Then again if something were truly not existing 
What need would there be for a cause
 There can be no transformation of a non-phenomenon 
Even by means of a hundred million causes 
How can something in that state become a functional phenomenon 
But what else could come into functional existence
 If it isnt a functional phenomenon 
   at the time of being a non-phenomenon 
When will it come to exist as a functional phenomenon 
But without its functional existence coming to arise 
It wont leave being a non-phenomenon
 Without leaving being a non-phenomenon 
No occasion will occur for its coming to exist 
   as a functional phenomenon 
And a functional phenomenon cannot go to a state 
   of nonfunctionality 
Because it would absurdly follow that it had a bipolar true nature
 In that way as cessation doesnt truly exist 
And the arising of phenomena doesnt truly exist either 
Thus this entire world always has been 
Non-truly arising and non-truly ceasing
 Therefore wandering beings resemble a dream 
Upon discerning analysis theyre the same as a plantain tree 
Whether theyre released with nirvana or not released 
Theres no difference in their actual way of existing
 With all phenomena devoid in that way 
What is there that wouldve been received 
What is there that wouldve been taken away 
Who is there wholl become shown respect or contempt 
   and by whom 

 What is there from which theres pleasure or pain 
What is there to be disliked or liked 
What craving is there thats searching 
   for an actual findable nature 
And what is it for that theres craving
 Upon discerning analysis what world of living beings is there 
Who is possibly there that will die from here 
Who is there thatll come to exist Who is there that has existed 
Who is there that is a relative Who is there that is a friend 
   And who is there whose friend it is
 Those of my type understand please 
That all of them are like space
But those wishing for happiness for a self 
Get agitated and overexcited
 Through fights and festivities as the cause 
And then through the resulting distress and overexertion 
Disheartening disputes and knifings and stabbings of each other 
They pass their lives with tremendous difficulties 
   through their negative acts
 And despite coming and coming to the better rebirth states 
And experiencing and experiencing manifold pleasures 
They fall after death to the worse rebirth states 
And unbearable sufferings for a very long time
 In compulsive existence cliffs to fall from are aplenty 
And there its like this when actuality is not known 
But since this and whats there in fact contradict one another 
In compulsive existence its not like this when actuality is known
 There too there are incomparable violent 
Oceans of suffering beyond any end 
There like that theres little strength 
There as well theres little life span
 There as well with activities 
   for longevity and health 
With hunger and exhaustion 
With sleep and calamities and likewise 
With fruitless company with infantile people
 A lifetime passes quickly and in vain 
Yet analytical discernment is so difficult to gain 
So there as well wheres there a means 
For turning back chronic distraction
 There as well demonic force is working hard 
To bring about a fall to the most awful rebirth states 
There because theres a profusion of false paths 
Indecisively wavering is so hard to transcend
 And with the difficulty of gaining a respite again 
And the advent of a Buddha even more difficult to gain 
And the rapids of disturbing emotion 
   so difficult to get out of 
Alas suffering will just go on and on
 Oh dear its really fit to feel sad 
About those who are caught in a rapids of suffering 
And who fail to see their own terrible situations 
Although theyre in extremely terrible states
 For example just as some people 
   abluting and abluting 
Would jump into fire again and again 
And though in extremely terrible states 
Proudly consider themselves 
   in extremely wonderful situations
 Likewise there are those who frolic about 
Fooling around as if there werent old age and death 
But first theyll be made to lose their lives 
And then comes an unbearable fall to a worse rebirth state
 Oh when shall I come to bring peace 
To those tortured by the fires of sufferings like that 
With a rain of my buildup of happiness 
Pouring forth from the clouds of my positive force
 Oh when shall I respectfully build up a network 
   of positive force 
In a manner of no mental aim at impossible existence 
And then teach voidness to those 
Whove been ruined by such mental aim

 Through my constructive act of having reflected upon 
   and composed Engaging in Bodhisattva Behavior 
May all wandering beings become adornments for the world 
Engaged in the behavior of bodhisattvas
 As many beings as there are in all directions 
Diseased with sufferings of body and mind 
May they all obtain oceans of happiness and joy 
Through the forces of my positive acts
 To the end of their recurring samsara 
May their happiness never become old and decrepit 
Instead may those who wander obtain without interruption 
The bodhisattvas unsurpassed bliss
 Whatever joyless realm beings as many as there are 
Throughout the realms of the world 
May those beings with limited bodies all enjoy 
The joy and bliss of a Pure Land of Bliss
 May those tortured by cold find warmth 
And those tortured by heat be cooled 
By the boundless oceans of water pouring down 
From the billowing clouds of bodhisattvas
 May the sword-leaved forest become for them 
A beautiful pleasure-grove 
And may the diabolical trees of thorns 
Transform into wish-granting trees
 May the joyless realm regions become delights 
With lakes fragrant from lake-born lotuses thickly rising up 
And made enchanting with the bewitching cries 
Of cranes wild ducks geese swans and the like
 May those mounds of glowing charcoals become mounds of gems 
And the flaming ground a polished mosaic floor of crystal 
And may the mountains of the crushing joyless realms become 
Celestial temples for offerings filled with Buddhas Gone to Bliss
 May the missiles of glowing charcoals and burning rocks 
From this day on become a rain of flowers 
And may bombarding battle with those missiles one against the other 
From this day on become tossing battle with flowers
   for frolic sake
 May those sunk in the Uncrossable Infernal River 
   with waters like fire 
All their flesh fallen off skeletons jasmine in color 
Gain the bodies of celestials by the force of my constructive deeds 
And bask in the Gently Flowing Heavenly River 
   in the company of celestial maidens
 Wondering Why are the terrifying henchmen of the Lord of Death 
   crows and vultures here suddenly scared 
And whose is this soothing moonlike force 
   thats eclipsing the darkness everywhere 
   and giving rise to our happiness and joy 
Gazing upward and having beheld a shining Vajrapani 
   poised in the expanse of the sky 
From the strength of delight their dark karmic forces dispelled 
   may they depart in his company together with him 
    
 Seeing the joyless realm fires fizzle and fade out 
From a falling rain of water lilies mixed with scented water 
And wondering What can this be suddenly relieved with joy 
May these joyless realm beings behold Kamalapani 
   Water Lily in His Hand
 Friends shed your fears and come Come here quickly 
   Were brought back to life 
Whos come before us Its the radiant Youth with Five Knots of Hair 
   Manjushri the bestower of fearlessness 
By whose power all sufferings removed 
   rushing streams of joy flow forth 
And bodhichitta is born as is loving affection the mother nurturing 
   those who wander everywhere
 All of you behold him whose lotus feet are touched in honor 
   by the crowned foreheads of hundreds of celestial beings 
Whose gaze is moist with compassion and on whose 
   head rains a shower of assorted flowers 
Tossed from rooftop chambers delightful with the singing 
   of thousands of celestial maidens resounding his praise 
Seeing Manjughosha before them like that 
   may the joyless realm beings instantly raise a cheer
 Thus beholding through my constructive acts as the roots 
Unobscured clouds of bodhisattvas – Samantabhadra and the rest - 
Showering cool fragrant rains of joy 
May those joyless realm beings rejoice
May the intense pains and fears 
Of the joyless realm beings be stilled 
And may everyone living in the worse rebirth states 
Be freed from the worse rebirth states
 May animals be parted from the fear 
Of being devoured by each other 
And may the clutching ghosts 
Become as happy as the people 
   of the Northern Island-World
 May the clutching ghosts 
Be satiated bathed and cooled forever 
By streams of milk pouring from the hand 
Of Arya Avalokiteshvara 

 May the blind see sights 
And forever may the deaf hear sounds 
And may the pregnant give birth 
Without any pain as did Shakyamunis mother Mayadevi
 May the naked find clothing 
The hungry food 
And the thirsty water 
And delicious things to drink
 May the poor find wealth 
Those stricken with grief find joy 
And may the discouraged become uplifted 
And perfectly steadfast
 May as many limited beings as are sick 
Be swiftly set free from sickness 
And may the sicknesses of wandering beings 
Without exception never recur
 May those with fear become fearless 
Those in bondage be released 
Those lacking strength become strong 
And their hearts become friendly toward each other
 May every direction 
Be auspicious for all travelers 
And whatever aims theyre going for 
Be accomplished without any need for effort
 May those who set out on boats and ships 
Succeed in fulfilling their hearts desires 
And safely returning to the waters shore 
Rejoice with their families
 May those whove strayed onto desolate detours 
Meet fellow travelers and without fear 
Of thieves bandits tigers and the like 
Journey at ease without fatigue
 May those fallen asleep become drunk or deranged 
In danger in trackless tracts such as jungles and the like 
As well as the young and the elderly without any guardian 
Be protected by the gods
 May they be free from all states that lack respite 
Be endowed with belief in the facts discriminating awareness 
   and affectionate care 
Have a splendid sustenance appearance and demeanor 
And always be mindful of previous lives
 May everyone have inexhaustible wealth 
As with a Treasury of Space 
And without dispute and without any violence 
Use it according to their personal wills
 May those limited beings who have little splendor 
Come to have magnificent splendor 
And may those in difficult straits with disfigured bodies 
Come to have splendid beautiful bodies
 As many women as there are in the world 
May they attain the status of men 
And may the lowly attain high position 
And the arrogant become humble
 By this positive force of mine 
May all limited beings without an exception 
Rid themselves of all negative acts 
And always engage in what is constructive
 May they never be parted from a bodhichitta aim 
May they be absorbed in bodhisattva behavior 
May they be taken care of by the Buddhas 
And be rid of Maras demonic acts
 May all limited beings 
Have immeasurably long lives 
May they always live happily 
Without the word death being even known
 May all directions abound 
With pleasure groves of wish-granting trees 
Replete with Buddhas and Buddhas spiritual offspring 
Proclaiming the melodious Dharma
 May the ground everywhere 
Lie as smooth as the palm of the hand 
Free of pebbles and the like 
Gentle and be made of beryl
 As the circles of disciples 
May hosts of bodhisattvas be seated all around 
Gracing the surface of the earth 
With their personal splendor
 May all embodied beings 
Unceasingly hear the melodious Dharma 
From birds from trees 
From all beams of light and even from the sky
 May they always encounter the Buddhas 
And the Buddhas spiritual offspring 
And make offerings to the Spiritual Teacher of the World 
With clouds of offerings without any end
 May the gods cause timely rains to fall 
And may there be bountiful harvests 
May kings rule in accord with the Dharma 
And the people of the world thrive well
 May medicines be potent 
And the chanting of hidden mantras be successful 
May dakini-witches cannibal demons and the likes 
Be endowed with compassionate minds
 May no limited being ever have pain 
Nor act with negative force nor be sick 
Nor be frightened nor be derided 
Nor ever be depressed
 May the monasteries be well-established 
Spread with reading and recitation 
May the monastic community be always in harmony 
And the monastic purpose be fulfilled
 May monks who wish to train their minds 
Find isolated places 
And being rid of all distractions 
Absorb themselves in meditation 
   their minds fit for the task
 May nuns have material support 
And be rid of conflict and harm 
And likewise may all renunciates 
Have unbroken ethical discipline
 May those with poor ethical discipline 
   being disgusted 
Devote themselves always to cleansing themselves 
   of their negative karmic force 
And once theyve reached the better rebirth states 
May their vows of tamed behavior remain unbroken
 May the learned be shown respect 
And receive alms and material support 
May their mental continuums be completely pure 
And their fame renowned in all directions
 Without experiencing the sufferings 
   of the worse rebirth states 
And without conduct thats difficult to carry out 
May wandering beings swiftly attain Buddhahood 
With bodies superior to those of the gods
 May all limited beings honor all the Buddhas 
Numerous times and in numerous ways 
And may they always be happy to the highest degree 
With the inconceivable bliss of the Buddhas
 May the bodhisattvas heart-wishes 
To be able to benefit the world be fulfilled 
And may whatever those guardians have intended 
Indeed come to pass for limited beings
 May the self-realized pratyekabuddhas be happy 
And likewise the shravaka listeners 
Always being honored with respect 
By gods anti-gods and by men
 And may I too through the kindness of Manjughosha 
Always gain mindfulness of previous lives 
And ordination as a renunciate 
Till attaining the realized bodhisattva first stage of mind 
   the Joyous One
 May I live filled with strength 
On a simple diet of food even just grain 
And may I obtain isolated places to live in 
Filled with perfection in all of my lives
 Whenever I might wish to see 
Or might wish to ask about any little thing 
May I behold the Guardian Manjunatha himself 
Without any impediment
 Just as Manjushri works 
To fulfill the aims of all limited beings 
To the far reaches of space in the ten directions 
May my behavior become just like that
 For as long as space remains 
And for as long as wandering beings remain 
May I too remain for that long 
Dispelling the sufferings of wandering beings
 Whatever sufferings wandering beings might have 
May all of them ripen on me 
And through the bodhisattva assembly 
May wandering beings enjoy happiness
 May the teachings the sole medicine 
   for the sufferings of wandering beings 
And the source of all happiness 
Continue to endure for a very long time 
With material support and shows of respect
 I prostrate to Manjughosha through whose kindness 
My thought has become constructive 
I prostrate as well to my spiritual teacher and friend 
Through whose kindness Ive been able to have it expand
